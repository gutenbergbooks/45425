<h2><a name="INTRODUCTION" id="INTRODUCTION">INTRODUCTION</a><br />
<span class="smaller">TO THE ENGLISH EDITION</span></h2>

<p>It is a curious gap in our economic literature that no
simple introductory study of Mediaeval Guilds has yet
been published in England. The subject is, of course,
dealt with in passing in every text-book of economic
history, and there have been several admirable studies
of particular aspects of Mediaeval Guild organization,
particularly of the period of its decay; but no one has
yet attempted to write a short account of the system
as a whole, such as might serve as a text-book for those
who desire to get a general knowledge of the industrial
system of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>This is all the more remarkable, because to an
increasing extent in recent years men&rsquo;s thoughts have
turned back to the Mediaeval Guilds in their search for
solutions of present-day industrial problems. Nor is
this tendency entirely new, though it has recently
assumed a new form. The earlier Trade Unions often
sought to establish their direct descent from the Guilds
of the Middle Ages: one of the most ambitious projects
of the Owenite period in British Trade Unionism was
the &ldquo;Builders&rsquo; Guild&rdquo; of 1834; and, a generation
later, William Morris, and to a less extent John Ruskin,
constantly strove to carry men&rsquo;s minds back to the
industrial order which passed away with the first
beginnings of modern capitalism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[Pg x]</a></span></p>

<p>Moreover, in our own times, an even more determined
attempt is being made to apply the lessons
of the Middle Ages to modern industrial problems.
Mr. A. J. Penty&rsquo;s <i>The Restoration of the Guild System</i>,
published in 1907, began this movement, which was
then taken up and transformed into the constructive
theory of National Guilds, first by Mr. A. R. Orage and
Mr. S. G. Hobson in the <i>New Age</i>, and later by the
writers and speakers of the National Guilds League.
A substantial literature, all of which assumes at least
a general acquaintance with mediaeval conditions,
has grown up around this movement; but so far
no National Guildsman has attempted to write the
history of the Mediaeval Guilds, or even to explain at
all clearly their relation to the system which he sets
out to advocate.</p>

<p>Until this very necessary work is executed, the
present translation of M. Renard&rsquo;s study of Mediaeval
Guilds should fill a useful place. Indeed, in some ways,
M. Renard has the advantage. He is not a National
Guildsman, but a moderate French Socialist of the
political school, and he therefore presents the history
of the Guilds without a preconceived bias in their
favour. It is no small part of the value of M. Renard&rsquo;s
study that he brings out the defects of the mediaeval
system quite as clearly as its merits.</p>

<p>It must be clearly stated at the outset that the
value which a study of Mediaeval Guilds possesses for
the modern world is not based on any historical continuity.
The value lies rather in the very discontinuity
of economic history, in the sharp break which modern
industrialism has made with the past. Historians of
Labour combination have often pointed out that the
Trade Unions of the modern world are not in any
sense descended from the Guilds of the Middle Ages,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[Pg xi]</a></span>
and have no direct or genealogical connection with
them. This is true, and the connection which has
sometimes been assumed has been shown to be quite
imaginary. But it does not follow that, because there
is no historical connection, there is not a spiritual
connection, a common motive present in both forms
of association. This connection, indeed, is now beginning
to be widely understood. As the Trade Union
movement develops in power and intelligence, it
inevitably stretches out its hands towards the control
of industry. The Trade Union, no doubt, begins as
a mere bargaining body, &ldquo;a continuous association of
wage-earners for the purpose of maintaining or improving
their conditions of employment&rdquo;; but it
cannot grow to its full stature without becoming far
more than this, without claiming for itself and its
members the right to control production. At first
this claim may be almost unconscious; but out of it
grows a conscious theory of Trade Union purpose.
The Syndicalist movement, native to France, but
spreading the influence of its ideas over the whole
industrialized world, the Industrial Unionist movement,
the American equivalent of Syndicalism, and
our own doctrine of National Guilds, or Guild Socialism,
are all conscious attempts to build a policy upon the
half-conscious tendencies of Trade Union action. In
all these the claim is made in varying forms that the
workers themselves shall control in the common interest
the industries in which they are engaged.</p>

<p>In one of these theories at least there is a conscious
retrospection to the Middle Ages. National Guildsmen
are seeking to formulate for modern industrial
Society a principle of industrial self-government
analogous to that which was embodied in the Mediaeval
Guilds. They do not idealize the Middle Ages; but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[Pg xii]</a></span>
they realize that the old Guild system did embody a
great and valuable principle which the modern world
has forgotten. They are not setting out to restore
the Middle Ages; but they are setting out to find a
democratic form of industrial autonomy which will
spring from the principle which inspired the economic
system of mediaeval Europe.</p>

<p>Mediaeval Guilds assumed many different forms
under the varying circumstances of their origin&mdash;in
Holland and Italy, France and England, Scotland and
Germany. But, underlying all their different manifestations,
a fundamental identity of principle can be
found; for, in all, the direct control of industry was
in the hands of the associated producers. The relations
of the Guilds to other forms of association differed
widely from time to time and from place to place. In
some cases the Guilds dominated and almost constituted
the State or the municipal authority; in others,
the power of the State and the municipality were freely
exercised to keep them under control. But, whatever
their exact relationship to other social powers, their
essential character persisted. It was an axiom of
mediaeval industry that direct management and
control should be in the hands of the producers under
a system of regulation in the common interest.</p>

<p>With these general observations in mind, we can
now proceed to look more closely at the actual form
which mediaeval organization assumed, particularly
in this country. M. Renard naturally has the Continental,
and especially the French, examples mainly
in mind. We must therefore in this introduction
dwell particularly upon the conditions which prevailed
in mediaeval England.</p>

<p>It was in the Middle Ages that, for the first time,
both the English national State and English industry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[Pg xiii]</a></span>
assumed definite shapes and forms of organization, and
entered into more or less defined and constant relationships.
Concerning their organization, and, still more,
concerning the actual, and substantial relations between
them, there are many points of obscurity which may
never be cleared up; but, apart from special obscurities,
the main structure of mediaeval economic life is
clearly known. Just as, in the manorial system,
agriculture assumed a clear and definite relationship
to the feudal State, so, with the rise of town life and
the beginnings of an industrial system, the Mediaeval
Guilds found a defined sphere and function in the
structure of Society and a defined relation to the
mediaeval State.</p>

<p>It is always necessary, in considering the economic
life of the Middle Ages, to bear in mind the relatively
tiny place which industry occupied in Society. England,
and indeed every country, was predominantly
agricultural; and England differed from the more
advanced Continental countries in that she was long
an exporter of raw materials and an importer of manufactured
goods. This is the main reason why the
Mediaeval Guild system never reached, in this country,
anything like the power or dimensions to which it
attained in Flanders, in Italy, and in parts of Germany.
But, even if English Guilds were less perfect specimens,
they nevertheless illustrated essentially the same
tendencies; and the economic structure of mediaeval
England was essentially the same as that which prevailed
throughout civilized Europe. It is indeed a
structure which, at one period or another, has existed
over practically the whole of the civilized world.</p>

<p>Industry was carried on under a system of enterprise
at once public and private, associative and
individual. The unit of production was the workshop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[Pg xiv]</a></span>
of the individual master-craftsman; but the craftsman
held his position as a master only by virtue of full
membership in his Craft Guild. He was not free to
adopt any methods of production or any scale of production
he might choose; he was subjected to an
elaborate regulation of both the quantity and the
quality of his products, of the price which he should
charge to the consumer, and of his relations to his
journeymen and apprentices. He worked within a
clearly defined code of rules which had the object at
once of safeguarding the independence, equality and
prosperity of the craftsmen, of keeping broad the
highway of promotion from apprentice to journeyman
and from journeyman to master, and also of preserving
the integrity and well-being of the craft by guarding
the consumer against exploitation and shoddy goods.</p>

<p>The Guild was thus internally a self-regulating unit
laying down the conditions under which production
was to be carried on, and occupying a recognized
status in the community based on the performance of
certain communal functions. It was not, however,
wholly independent or self-contained; it had intimate
relations with other Guilds, with the municipal
authority of the town in which it was situated, and,
in increasing measure, with the national State within
whose area it lay. There is about these relations,
with which we are here primarily concerned, a considerably
greater obscurity than about the main structure
of industrial organization. In particular, one of
the most obscure chapters in English industrial history
is that which deals with the relation between the Craft
Guilds of which we have been speaking and the municipal
authorities.</p>

<p>In the great days of the Guild system the industrial
market was almost entirely local. Long-distance or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[Pg xv]</a></span>
overseas trade existed only in a few commodities, and,
in this country, these were almost entirely raw
materials or easily portable luxuries. England was,
as we have seen, an agricultural country, and the
nascent industry of the towns existed only to supply
a limited range of commodities within a restricted
local market. While these conditions remained in
being, organization developed in each town separately,
and industry came hardly at all into touch with the
national State. Then, gradually, the market widened
and the demand for manufactured commodities
increased. As this happened, industry began to overflow
the boundaries set to it by the purely local Guild
organization. Foreign trade, and to a less extent
internal exchange, increased in variety and amount;
and a distinct class of traders, separated from the
craftsmen-producers, grew steadily in power and
prominence. New industries, moreover, and rival
methods of industrial organization began to grow up
outside the towns and to challenge the supremacy of
the Guilds; while, in the Guilds themselves, the
system of regulation began to break down, and inequality
of wealth and social consideration among the
Guildsmen destroyed the democratic basis of the
earlier Guild organization.</p>

<p>These developments coincided in time with a big
growth in the power and organization of the national
State, a growth based largely on the imposition of a
common justice and the establishment of a common
security. This made possible, while the parallel
economic developments made necessary, a national
economic policy; and the State, beginning with the
woollen industry, then after agriculture of by far the
greatest national and international importance, began
to develop a policy of economic intervention. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi">[Pg xvi]</a></span>
State had intervened in agriculture after the Black
Death; even earlier it had begun its long series of
interventions in connection with the woollen industry;
in 1381 the first Navigation Act was passed; and
during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries complicated
codes of industrial regulation by the State became the
rule and practice of English statecraft.</p>

<p>We have then to distinguish already two periods
in which the State assumed differing relations to
mediaeval industrial organization. In the earlier days
of the Guild system industry was local in character,
and the Guilds came into relations primarily with the
municipal authority, and only occasionally with the
State, even when the Guild charter was obtained
directly from the Crown. In the second period, when
the Guild system was already at the beginning of its
long period of disintegration, the State was developing
a comprehensive economic policy which covered every
aspect of industrial organization.</p>

<p>Let us look rather more closely at the first of these
two periods, the period of the rise and predominance
of Guild organization; and let us repeat our question
as to the relations which existed between the Guilds
and the State or municipal authority. The first form
of Guild organization in this country was undoubtedly
that of the &ldquo;Guild Merchant,&rdquo; a general organization
including both trading and manufacturing elements,
and deriving special privileges for its trade by virtue
of a Charter secured directly from the Crown. Here,
then, is our first clear relation. The Guild Merchant
derived, if not its organization, at any rate its privileges
and authority, from the direct grant of the State. In
practice the principal power thus acquired was the
right to trade throughout the kingdom. The relations
of the Guild Merchant to the municipal authorities are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii">[Pg xvii]</a></span>
far more obscure. It used to be maintained that they
were identical; but this view has been clearly disproved.
We cannot, however, trace many signs of
the active intervention of the municipality in the
affairs of the Guild Merchant, though it is clear that
the jurisdiction of the City authorities remained, in
form at least, unaffected by the creation of a Guild
Merchant.</p>

<p>The Guilds Merchant reached their zenith in the
twelfth century. Thereafter, as trade and industry
grew in extent and complexity, the general organization
of all merchants and master-craftsmen in a single body
gave way to a system of Craft Guilds, each representing
as a rule a single craft or &ldquo;mistery.&rdquo; Some of these
Guilds were predominantly Guilds of traders, some of
producers; while some included both trading and
producing elements. By the fourteenth century the
Guilds Merchant had everywhere disappeared, and the
Craft Guilds were in possession of the field. Thus came
into being the organization of industry generally known
as the &ldquo;Mediaeval Guild system.&rdquo;</p>

<p>What, then, were the relations of these Craft Guilds
to the municipalities and to the State? They arose,
we have seen, out of the ashes of the Guild Merchant.
Often they were definitely created and fostered by the
municipal authorities. The borough claimed the right
of regulating production and trade in the interest of
its burgesses, the right to uphold quality of product
and fair dealing, to punish offenders, and in the last
resort to fix both the prices of commodities and the
remuneration of journeymen and apprentices. The
greater part of these functions was actually exercised
by the Crafts themselves, which, as we have seen, made
their own regulations for the ordering of trade and
production; but the city authorities always main<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii">[Pg xviii]</a></span>tained
and asserted a right of intervention in the affairs
of the Guilds whenever the well-being and good service
of the consumer were involved; and this right was
frequently exercised in the case of the Guilds which
organized the supply of food and drink. Neither the
limits of Guild authority nor the limits of municipal
intervention were accurately or uniformly defined. In
practice the system oscillated from the one side to
the other. Sometimes the Guilds asserted and maintained
a comparative immunity from municipal regulation,
and sometimes a recalcitrant Guild was brought
to book by a strong-handed municipal authority.
The poise and balance between the parties was in many
cases made the more even because both alike often
derived their authority from a special Charter granted
by the Crown. Indeed, one of the regular resorts of
the Craft Guild, in its battle for independence from
outside control, was to get from the Crown a
definite Charter of incorporation, granting to the
Guild the widest range of powers that it was able
to secure.</p>

<p>The Guild was essentially a local organization, and,
in placing it in its relation to the municipal authority,
we are describing it in its essential economic character.
Its relation to the national State, like that of the
municipality itself, was far more occasional and incidental,
and, apart from one or two broad issues of
policy connected mainly with the woollen industry,
the interest of the national State in the towns, and
therefore in industrial organization, was primarily
financial. The protection of the consumer was a very
minor motive; the stimulation of urban industry had
hardly become a general object of policy systematically
pursued; and the granting of Charters, whether to
town or to Guild, was far less a matter of economic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xix" id="Page_xix">[Pg xix]</a></span>
policy than an obvious device for raising the wind.
Charters were always most plentiful when the Crown
was most in need of money.</p>

<p>The period of merely occasional intervention in
industry by the State lasted down to the time of
Elizabeth, when for the first time the State undertook
a comprehensive system of industrial regulation.
This, however, no longer meant the exclusive dominance
of financial considerations, although the need for
raising money was always very present to the minds
of Elizabeth and her ministers. The new policy was
primarily political in motive rather than economic, and
was directed on the one side to the fostering and
development of trade, and on the other to the conservation
of the man-power of the nation. The Elizabethan
Statute of Artificers, passed in 1563, laid down
elaborate provisions both for regulating the flow of
labour into various classes of occupations and for
prescribing the conditions under which the work was
to be carried on. Attention in modern times has been
mainly directed to the clauses dealing with wages;
but the principle of the Act was very much wider than
any mere regulation of wages. It rested upon the
principle of compulsory labour for all who were not in
possession of independent means; and its basis was
the obligation upon every one who could not show
cause to the contrary to labour on the land. At the
same time it aimed at protecting the supply of labour
for the urban industries, and, still more, at giving to
urban industry an advantage against the growing competition
of the country-side. In short, it incorporated
a general scheme for the redistribution of the national
man-power in accordance with a definite conception of
national policy. This distribution was accomplished
mainly by an elaborate code of regulations for appren<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xx" id="Page_xx">[Pg xx]</a></span>ticeship,
parts of which lived on right into the nineteenth
century.</p>

<p>With this regulation of trade and commerce went
also a regulation of wages. As in the case of the
Statute of Labourers, the object was primarily that of
preventing the labourer from earning more than his
customary standard, allowing for variations in the
cost of living. The rates of wages which the Justices
of the Peace were ordered to fix were thus primarily
<i>maxima</i>, and the Act contained stringent penalties
against those who obtained, or paid, more than these
<i>maxima</i>. In some cases, however, if rarely, the rates
laid down were also <i>minima</i>, and employers were fined
for paying less. This was, however, clearly exceptional,
and a special declaratory Act passed under James I.,
which clearly empowered the justices to fix binding
minimum rates, shows that there had been legal doubt
about it.</p>

<p>In any case the general tendency of the Tudor
legislation is clear. It aimed at establishing and
enforcing by law the existing social structure, at
standardizing the relations between the classes, and at
putting them all in their places under the direction
of the sovereign State. In short, the Tudor system
represents, in the most complete form possible, the
State regulation of private industry.</p>

<p>While these measures were being taken by the
State, the Guild system was in decay. As wealth grew
and accumulated, the tendencies towards oligarchy
within the Guilds and exclusiveness in relation to outsiders
grew more and more marked. Among the
Guildsmen wide social distinctions appeared, and the
master-craftsman before long found himself, in relation
to the rich trader or large-scale manufacturer, very
much in the position of a labourer in relation to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxi" id="Page_xxi">[Pg xxi]</a></span>
employer. The richer Guilds, especially those connected
with trade, sought by the limitation of entry
and the exaction of high entrance fees and dues after
entry, to keep the Guild &ldquo;select&rdquo; and establish an
oligarchy in its government. At the same time the
growth of new industries which had never come under
Guild regulation, and the grant by the Crown of special
privileges to individual monopolists and patentees,
contributed to the downfall of the old system. Where
the Guilds did not die, they were transformed into
exclusive and privileged companies which in no sense
carried on the mediaeval tradition.</p>

<p>Especially in the later stages of Guild development,
and with growing intensity as they drew nearer to
decay and dissolution, struggles raged in many of the
Guilds and between Guild and Guild among the diverse
elements of which they had come to be composed.
M. Renard speaks of struggles in the Guilds of Florence
between the more and less capitalistic and powerful
elements, and Mr. George Unwin, in his book on
<i>Industrial Organisation in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth
Centuries</i>, has presented a picture of similar struggles
in the Guilds of England. These conflicts, however
various in some respects, assumed mainly the form of
a constant struggle for supremacy between the craftsmen-producers
who were typical of the great days of
the Guilds and the trading or merchant class which was
gradually extending its control over production as well
as sale. Gradually, as capital accumulated in the
hands of the traders, the rift between them and the
master-craftsmen widened and, gradually too, the
master-craftsmen lost their independence and their
status as free producers. Not only the marketing of
the goods which they produced, but also the essential
raw materials of their crafts, passed under the control<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxii" id="Page_xxii">[Pg xxii]</a></span>
of the traders, either by the operation of economic
forces alone, or by the purchase of some valuable
concession or monopoly from the Crown. Moreover,
where the actual producer retained his power, he did
so by a transformation of function. Gradually, he
turned into a capitalist trader and lost all unity of
interest and outlook with the working craftsman.</p>

<p>We need not here follow the Guild system through
its later stages of decay and dissolution. Where the
Guilds did not die they shrank up as a rule into
capitalistic and oligarchical associations. Step by
step, power within the Guild was taken away from the
ordinary Guild member by the creation of privileged
orders, access to which was possible only to &ldquo;men of
substance.&rdquo; This process of oligarchization can be
traced very clearly in Mr. George Unwin&rsquo;s admirable
history of the Guilds and Companies of London. No
doubt its coming was more obvious in London than in
smaller industrial centres; but the essential features
of the change were everywhere substantially the same.
The constant attacks on patents and monopolies in the
later years of the reign of Elizabeth and under the
Stuarts were, in part, attacks upon the privileges
granted to mere courtiers and adventurers; but when
monopoly came their way, the undemocratic Guilds
and Livery Companies were to the full as forward in
abusing their powers as the merest of adventurers
who found or bought the royal favour.</p>

<p>From the time of the Stuarts, at least, the Guild
system had ceased to count at all as a method of
industrial organization. It is doubtful whether, even
in their greatest days, the Guilds ever included the
whole personnel of the trades and industries which
they controlled, and it is certain that, as the tendency
towards oligarchy became manifest in them, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiii" id="Page_xxiii">[Pg xxiii]</a></span>
included a steadily decreasing proportion of those
whose work they claimed to regulate. Moreover, even
of those whom they included, a steadily decreasing
number retained any control over their policy.</p>

<p>This decay of the Guilds, however, is not of primary
importance for those who seek to learn lessons from
their experience. If we would judge them and learn
from them, we must study them as they were in the
time of their greatest prosperity and power, before the
coming of capitalistic conditions had broken their
democracy in pieces and destroyed their essential
character. Viewed in this aspect, the Guild system
was essentially a balance, made the easier to maintain
because it was not so much a balance of powers between
different groups of persons with widely divergent
interests as a balance between the same persons
grouped in different ways, for the performance of
different social functions. The municipal authority
was, as a rule, largely dominated by the Guilds; and
in turn the Guilds were largely dominated by the civic
spirit. The distinction between producer and consumer
was important; but it was not so much a
distinction between opposing social classes as between
friendly and complementary forms of social organization.
In proportion as this was not the case, the
balance on which the Guild system rested tended to
break down; but the occasion of its breakdown was
not the irreconcilable opposition of producer and consumer,
but the struggles within the Guilds themselves
between traders and craftsmen, or between exclusive
and democratic tendencies.</p>

<p>The mediaeval organization of industry, then, was
based upon the twin ideas of function and balance.
It was an organization designed for an almost self-contained
local type of Society, and before the coming<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxiv" id="Page_xxiv">[Pg xxiv]</a></span>
of national and international economy it broke down
and fell to pieces. As a local system of organization
it reached its greatest perfection in those countries
in which town life was strongest and national government
weakest (<i>e.g.</i> in the Hanse towns of Germany;
in Italy, and in Flanders). In this country the towns
never possessed the strength or the independence
necessary for the perfect development of the Guild
system; but even so all the essential principles of the
Guilds were operative.</p>

<p>The period since the breakdown of the Guilds has
been a period of national and international economy.
From the point of view of economic organization, it
falls into two contrasted halves&mdash;a period of State
supremacy in which the State assumed the supreme
direction of industrial affairs, and a period of State
abdication in the nineteenth century, during which
there was no collective organization, and economic
matters were left to the free play of economic forces
working in a <i>milieu</i> of competition. Positively, these
two periods stand to each other in sharp contrast;
negatively there is a point of close resemblance between
them. In neither was there any functional organization
co-ordinating and expressing the economic life of
the nation. In the first period the State regulated
industry as a universal and sovereign authority; in
the second period nobody at all was allowed to regulate
industry, which was supposed to regulate itself by a
sort of pre-ordained harmony of economic law. In both
periods the purely economic organizations directed
to the performance of specific functions which were
characteristic of mediaeval organization had disappeared,
or at all events had ceased to be the vital
regulating authorities in industrial affairs. Local
functional organizations had ceased to be adequate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xxv" id="Page_xxv">[Pg xxv]</a></span>
to the task of control; national functional organizations
had not yet come into being, or, at all events,
had not yet secured recognition.</p>

<p>To-day we stand at the beginning of a new period
of economic history. The Trade Union movement,
created mainly as a weapon of defence, is beginning to
challenge capitalist control of industry, and to suggest
the possibility of a new form of functional organization
adapted to the international economy of the modern
world. Already in Russia chaotic but heroic experiments
in workers&rsquo; control are taking place, and, in
every country, the minds of the workers are turning to
the idea of control over industry as the one escape
from the tyranny of capitalism and the wage system.
It is, then, of the first importance that, in framing the
functional democracy of twentieth-century industry,
we should cast back our minds to the functional
industrial democracy of the Middle Ages, in order that
we may learn what we can from its successes and its
failures, and, even more, gain living inspiration from
what is good and enduring in the spirit which inspired
the men who lived in it and under it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_I" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I</a><br />
<span class="smaller">ORIGIN AND GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION</span></h2>

<p>1. The origin of guilds has been the subject of a
great deal of discussion, and two opposing theories
have been advanced. According to the first theory
they were the persistence of earlier institutions; but
what were these institutions? Some say that, more
particularly in the south of France, they were of
Roman and Byzantine origin, and were derived from
those <i>collegia</i> of the poorer classes (<i>tenuiorum</i>) which,
in the last centuries of the Empire, chiefly concerned
themselves with the provision of funerals; or, again,
from the <i>scholae</i>, official and compulsory groups,
which, keeping the name of the hall in which their
councils assembled, prolonged their existence till
about the year 1000. According to others they were,
particularly in the north, of German origin, and were
derived from associations resembling artificial families,
the members of which mingled their blood and
exchanged vows to help each other under certain
definite circumstances; or again, they may have
descended in a straight line from the <i>ministeriales</i>,
the feudal servitors who, in every royal or feudal
domain of any extent, were grouped according to
their trade, under the authority of a <i>panetier</i>,<a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
<i>bouteillier</i>,<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> a head farrier, or a chief herdsman.
According to others again, the Church, that great
international association, had, by the example of its
monastic orders and religious brotherhoods, given the
laity lessons and examples of which they were not slow
to take advantage.</p>

<p>According to the opposite theory, each guild was a
separate creation, born, as it were, by spontaneous
generation, and had no connection with the past.
Associations (<i>gildae</i>), <i>scholae</i>, colleges&mdash;all had been
killed by the hostility of the central power before they
had had time to mature fully. They were children
of the necessity which compelled the weak to unite
for mutual defence in order to remedy the disorders
and abuses of which they were the victims. They
were the result of the great associative movement,
which, working by turns on political and economic
lines, first gave birth to the communes, and so created
a social environment in which they could live and
develop. The craftsmen, drawn together into one
street or quarter by a similar trade or occupation,
the tanners by the river, or the dockers by the port,
acquired for themselves in the towns which had won
more or less freedom the right to combine and to make
their own regulations.<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span></p>

<p>As is nearly always the case, there is a kernel of
truth in each of these opposing theories. Certainly it
is hardly likely that the germs or the wreckage of
trade associations, existing in the <i>collegia</i>, the <i>scholae</i>,
the associations, the groups in royal, feudal, or ecclesiastical
domains, should have totally disappeared, to
reappear almost immediately. Why so many deaths
followed by so many resurrections?</p>

<p>The provision trades in particular do not appear to
have ceased to be regulated and organized. If, as
Fustel de Coulanges says, &ldquo;history is the science of
becoming,&rdquo; it must here acknowledge that guilds
already existed potentially in society. It may even be
added that in certain cases, it was to the interest of
count or bishop to encourage their formation; for, as
he demanded compulsory payment in kind or in money,
it was to his advantage to have a responsible collective
body to deal with. It is certain, too, that religious
society, with its labouring or weaving monks (the
Benedictines or Umiliate for instance), with its bodies
of bridge-building brothers, with its lay brotherhoods,
was also tending to encourage the spirit of association.
But it is none the less true that these organisms,&mdash;if
not exactly formless, at any rate incomplete, unstable,
with little cohesion, and created with non-commercial
aims,&mdash;could not, without the influence of
favourable surroundings, have transformed themselves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
into guilds possessing statutes, magistrates, political
jurisdiction, and often political rights. It was necessary
that they should find, in Europe, social conditions
in which the need for union, felt by the mass of the
population, could act on their weakness and decadence
like an invigorating wind, infusing new life into them.
It was necessary that they should find in the town<a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
which sheltered them, a little independent centre,
which would permit the seeds of the future, which they
held, to grow and bear fruit unchecked.</p>

<p>It may then be concluded that there was, if not a
definite persistence of that which had already existed,
at least a survival out of the wreckage, or a development
of germs, which, thanks to the surrounding
conditions, underwent a complete metamorphosis.</p>

<p>2. What we have just said explains both how it was
that the guilds were not confined to any small region,
and why they were not of equal importance in all
the countries in which they were established. They
are to be met with in the whole of the Christian West,
in Italy as well as in France, in Germany as well as in
England. They were introduced simultaneously with
town life in the countries of the north. There is
sufficient authority for believing that the system which
they represent predominated in those days in the three
worlds which disputed the coasts and the supremacy
of the Mediterranean&mdash;the Roman Catholic, the
Byzantine, and the Mohammedan. Thus there reigned
in the basin of that great inland sea a sort of unity
of economic organization.</p>

<p>This unity, however, did not exclude variety. The
guilds were more alive and more powerful as the towns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
were more free. Consequently it was in Flanders, in
Italy, in the &ldquo;Imperial Towns,&rdquo; in the trading ports,
wherever, in fact, the central authority was weak or
distant, that they received the strongest impetus.</p>

<p>They prospered more brilliantly in the Italian
Republics than at Rome under the shadow of the Holy
See. In France, as in England, they had to reckon
with a jealous and suspicious royalty which has ever
proved a bad neighbour to liberty. The more commercial,
the more industrial the town, the more
numerous and full of life were the guilds; it was at
Bruges or at Ghent, at Florence or at Milan, at Strasburg
or at Barcelona, that they attained the height
of their greatness; at all points, that is, where trade
was already cosmopolitan, and where the woollen
industry, which was in those days the most advanced,
had the fullest measure of freedom and activity.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_II" id="CHAPTER_II">CHAPTER II</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE ORGANIZATION OF THE GUILDS</span></h2>

<p>1. It is sometimes imagined that the guilds united
all the merchants and all the craftsmen of one region.
This is a mistake. At first those who lived in the
country, with rare exceptions,<a name="FNanchor_5" id="FNanchor_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> did not belong to them:
certain towns, Lyons for instance, knew nothing of
this method of organization, and even in those towns
where it was in existence, there were trades which
remained outside, and there were also isolated workers
who shunned it&mdash;home-workers, who voluntarily or involuntarily
kept themselves apart from it.<a name="FNanchor_6" id="FNanchor_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Guilds, then,
were always privileged bodies, an aristocracy of labour.</p>

<p>It is also imagined that they were voluntary
organizations of a uniform type. There is the classic
division into three degrees or grades. Just as under
the feudal system, a man became successively page,
esquire, and knight, and it was necessary, in order
to rise from one stage of the hierarchy to the next,
to complete a certain time of service and of military
education, so in the guild organization, he was first
an apprentice for one or more years, then a journeyman
(<i>garçon</i>, <i>valet</i>, <i>compagnon</i>, <i>serviteur</i>), working<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
under the orders of others for an indeterminate period,
and finally, a master, established on his own account
and vested with full rights. Just as the knight, after
he had given proof of having finished his instruction,
had still, before putting on his golden spurs, to go
through a religious and symbolic service which included
the purifying bath, the oath, and the communion,
so the master, after having proved his
capabilities by examination or by the production
of a piece of fine craftsmanship, took the oath,
communicated, and fraternized with his fellows at a
solemn banquet. But this quasi-automatic promotion
from rank to rank was in fact far from being as
regular as has been imagined. It was not unusual
for one of the three grades, that of <i>compagnon</i>,
to be passed over, for the apprentice to rise directly
to the rank of master, and for the formalities of admission
to be reduced to a minimum for one who had
the good luck to be a master&rsquo;s son. From the earliest
times mastership tended to become hereditary, as did
the life fiefs held by barons and earls. Nor on the
other hand was it rare for a <i>compagnon</i> to find himself
for life at that grade without the possibility of rising
higher. Moreover, the famous divisions never existed,
except in certain trades.</p>

<p>The truth is that guild organization, even within
the walls of a single town, presented several different
types. It might be <i>simple</i>, or <i>complex</i>; it might be
either half democratic or capitalistic in structure.</p>

<p>2. It was simple when it included only one trade,
and this was fairly often the case. It was complex
when it was composed of several juxtaposed or superimposed
groups. In this case it was a federation of craft
guilds, each keeping its individual life, its own statutes,
and its own officers, but all united in a larger body of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
which they became members. This was the name which
at Florence was borne by those lesser bodies of which the
whole was composed.<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The whole was called an <i>Arte</i>,
and just as the <i>membri</i> could themselves be subdivided,
so the <i>Arte</i> might be defined as a union of unions.</p>

<p>The Middle Age was not an age of equality. Usually
among the groups united under a central government
there was one which predominated, which held fuller
corporate rights; the others, regarded as inferiors,
only enjoyed a greater or smaller part of such rights.
Some did not enjoy the privilege of co-operating in
the election of the federal magistrates, to whom none
the less they owed obedience; others were not allowed
to carry the banners, towards which they nevertheless
had to contribute their share.</p>

<p>Take, for example, the <i>Arte dei medici, speziali,
e merciai</i>, at Florence, which included, as may be
seen, three <i>membri</i>&mdash;doctors, apothecaries, and haberdashers.
This seems a heterogeneous assemblage, but
the first two are easily accounted for; and if the
connection is less clear between the last and these two,
it may be found in the fact that the haberdashers,
like the great shops of our own day, sold some of
everything, and consequently kept in their shops those
foreign drugs and spices of which the <i>speziali</i> were the
usual depositaries.<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> The complication is here increased
because the <i>speziali</i>, among whom Dante was enrolled,
included as subordinate <i>membri</i> the painters combined
with the colour merchants, while the saddlers were
coupled with the haberdashers.<a name="FNanchor_9" id="FNanchor_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span></p>

<p>It will easily be understood how troubled must have
been the life of associations formed of such diverse
elements. There was in each an endless succession
of internal struggles in the attempt to maintain between
the varying elements an equilibrium which was necessarily
unstable. Each &ldquo;member,&rdquo; according to the
number of its adherents, or according to the social
standing which it claimed, or which was accorded to
it by public opinion, fought for the mastery; but as
in the course of years their relative importance was
constantly modified, the constitution of the whole
body was for ever changing. No fixed principle regulated
its ceaseless mobility, or set on a solid basis the
organization of its compact but rival groups, of which
one or another was ever tempted to imagine itself
sacrificed.</p>

<p>3. The guild, when simple, was usually half democratic.
Being a bourgeois growth developing in feudal
surroundings, it rested, like the feudal system itself,
on two closely connected principles&mdash;hierarchy and
equality. It included several superposed grades,
while at the same time it assured identical rights to
everybody included in any one of those grades.
Masters, journeymen, and apprentices were ranked
one above another, but those of the same grade
were equals. Inequality could be, theoretically at
least, only temporary, since the master had once been
a journeyman, the journeyman was a prospective
master, and the apprentice in his turn would climb
to the top of the ladder. This state of things, however,
was only to be met with in the building trades,
in &ldquo;small&rdquo; industry and &ldquo;small&rdquo; commerce&mdash;the
most numerous it is true, but not the most powerful.
There alone was almost realized the idyllic
picture of the workman working in the workshop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>
beside his master, sharing his life, eating at his
table, his partner in joys and sorrows, joining him in
processions and at public ceremonies, until the day
when he himself should rise to be a master.</p>

<p>4. It is convenient to begin with the lowest grade
and work upwards. The apprentice was, as may be
imagined, the object of a somewhat keen solicitude.
Apprenticeship, in &ldquo;small&rdquo; industry, with which it
was intimately associated, was the means of maintaining
that professional skill on which the guild
prided itself. The apprentice was a child whom
his parents or guardians wished to be taught a
trade as soon as he was ten or twelve years of age,
although there was no fixed age limit. A master was
found who would take him. Every instructor must
be a master: he must also be of good life and
character, endowed with patience, and approved of
by the officers of the guild. If he were recognized
as capable of carrying out his duties, the two parties
bound themselves by a contract, often verbal, often
also made before a notary. This fixed the length of
the apprenticeship, which varied greatly in different
trades; for it might cover from one to six, eight,
ten, or twelve years; sometimes it stipulated for
a time of probation&mdash;usually a fortnight&mdash;during
which time either side could cancel the agreement.
The apprenticeship was not free of expense, at any
rate to begin with, and the child&rsquo;s guardians paid
an annual fee in corn, bread, or money. In return,
the child received his lodging, food, clothes, washing,
and light, and was supervised and taught in the
master&rsquo;s house. Certain contracts contain special
clauses: one states that the family will supply clothes
and boots; another, that the apprentice shall receive
a fixed salary after a certain time; another provides<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
for the circumstances under which the engagement
may be cancelled.<a name="FNanchor_10" id="FNanchor_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>The apprentice had certain obligations, which
sometimes, in spite of his youth, he solemnly swore
to keep (the oath has never been so much used as
in the Middle Ages). He promised to be industrious
and obedient, and to work for no other master. The
master, on his side, promised to teach him the secrets
of his craft, to treat him &ldquo;well and decently in sickness
as in health,&rdquo; and certain contracts add, &ldquo;provided
that the illness does not last longer than a month.&rdquo;
Naturally these duties carried with them certain rights.
The master might correct and beat the apprentice,
provided that he did it himself; a contract drawn up
with a rope-maker in Florence says, &ldquo;short of drawing
blood.&rdquo; It often happened that the apprentice, sick
of work or in a fit of ill-temper, ran away from his
master; a limit was then fixed for his return, and
his place was kept for him during his absence, which
sometimes lasted quite a long time (it has been known
to continue as long as twenty-six weeks). If he
returned within the time limit he was punished but
taken back; but if he indulged in three such escapades
he was dismissed, his parents had to indemnify the
master, and the truant was not allowed to go back to
the craft which he had abandoned.</p>

<p>However, an enquiry was held to decide whether
the master had abused his rights, and the officers of
the guild or the civil authority, as the case might be,
set at liberty any apprentice who had been unkindly
or inhumanly treated. We find a master prosecuted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
for having beaten and kicked an apprentice to death;
a mistress indicted for having forced into evil living
a young girl who had been entrusted to her care. In
such a case the apprentice was removed from his
unworthy master and put into safer hands. Sometimes
it happened that the master was attacked by a long
and serious illness, or that through trouble and poverty
he could no longer carry out his agreement.</p>

<p>A custom, however, sprang up which threatened to
wreck the system. This was the practice of buying
for money so many years or months of service, thus
establishing a privilege to the detriment of professional
knowledge and to the advantage of the well-to-do. A
sum of money took the place of actual instruction
received, and some apprentices at the end of two
years, others only at the end of four, obtained their
final certificate which allowed them to aspire to
mastership.</p>

<p>Attention should be called to the fact that there
are many statutes which limit the number of
apprentices. What was the motive of this limitation?
The reason which was usually put foremost&mdash;namely,
the difficulty one master would have in completing
the technical education of many pupils&mdash;does not
seem to have been always the most serious. Perhaps
a reduction was insisted on by the journeymen, for
it was usually to the interest of the masters to have
a great many apprentices, and to keep them for a
long time at that stage. They were so many helpers
to whom little or nothing was paid, although the
work exacted of them nearly equalled that of the
journeymen. Therefore we must not be astonished
if the latter looked unfavourably on these young
competitors who lowered the price of labour. The
poor apprentices were thus between the devil and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
deep sea. They suffered from the jealousy of the
journeymen as well as from the greed of the masters,
who cut down their allowance of food, and by keeping
them unreasonably long prevented them from earning
a decent living.</p>

<p>The literature of the times,<a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> when it deigns to notice
them, leaves us to infer that their existence was not
a particularly happy one; nevertheless it is only right
to add that their lot cannot be compared with that of
the wretched children who, in the opening years of the
era of machinery, were introduced in large numbers
into the great modern industries.</p>

<p>5. The journeymen (also called <i>valets</i>, <i>compagnons</i>,
<i>serviteurs</i>, <i>massips</i>, <i>locatifs</i>, <i>garçons</i>, etc.) were either
future masters or else workmen for life, unable to set
up for themselves because they lacked the indispensable
&ldquo;wherewithal,&rdquo; as certain statutes crudely express it.
Their time of apprenticeship over, they remained with
the master with whom they had lived; or else, especially
in the building trades, having perfected themselves
by travel, they went to the market for disengaged
hands<a name="FNanchor_12" id="FNanchor_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> and offered their services. They were hired
in certain places where the unemployed of all trades
assembled. They were required to give proof that
they were free of all other engagements, and to present
certificates, not only of capability, but of good conduct,
signed by their last master. Thieves, murderers, and
outlaws, and even &ldquo;dreamers&rdquo; and slackers, stood
no chance of being engaged, while those who, though
unmarried, took a woman about with them, or who
had contracted debts at the inns, were avoided. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>
were required to be decently clothed, not only out of
consideration for their clients, but also because they
had to live and work all day in the master&rsquo;s house.
The master, when he was satisfied with the references
given, and when he had assured himself that he was
not defrauding another master who had more need of
hands than himself, could engage the workman. The
contract which bound them was often verbal, but
there was a certain solemnity attaching to it; for the
workman had to swear on the Gospels and by the
saints that he would work in compliance with the
rules of the craft.</p>

<p>The engagement was of very varying duration; it
might be entered into for a year, a month, a week, or
a day. The workman who left before the time agreed
upon might be seized, forced to go back to the workshop,
and punished by a fine. If the master wished to dismiss
the workman before the date arranged, he had first to
state his reasons for so doing before a mixed assembly
composed of masters and journeymen. A mutual
indemnity seems to have been the rule, whether the
workman abandoned the work he had begun, or
whether the master prematurely dismissed the man
he had hired.<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>The journeyman had to work in his master&rsquo;s workshop,
and it was exceptional for him to go alone to a
client (in which case he was duly authorized by the
master), or to finish an urgent piece of work at home.
The length of the working day was regulated by the
daylight. Lighting was in those days so imperfect
that night work was forbidden, as nothing fine or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
highly finished could be done by the dim light of
candles. This rule could never be broken except in
certain crafts&mdash;by the founders, for example, whose
work could not be interrupted without serious loss&mdash;or
by those who worked for the king, the bishop, or the
lord.<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The rest worked from sunrise to sunset, an
arrangement which made summer and winter days
curiously unequal. Some neighbouring clock marked
the beginning and end of the day, and a few rests
amounting to about an hour and a half broke its
length. All this was very indefinite, and disputes were
frequent as to the time for entering or leaving the
workshop. The Paris workmen often complained of
being kept too late, and of the danger of being obliged
to go home in the dark at the mercy of thieves and
footpads. It was necessary for the royal provost to
issue a decree before the difficulty was overcome.</p>

<p>The workers, however, reaped the benefit of the
many holidays which starred the calendar and brought
a little brightness into the grey monotony of the days.
The Sunday holiday was scrupulously observed without
interfering with the Saturday afternoon, when work
stopped earlier, or the religious festivals which often
fell on a week day. It has been calculated<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> that the
days thus officially kept as holidays amounted to at
least thirty, and it may be safely said that work was
less continuous then than nowadays.</p>

<p>To leave work voluntarily at normal times was
strictly forbidden, and the police took up and imprisoned
any idlers or vagabonds found wandering
in the towns. But even in those days Monday was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
often taken as an unauthorized holiday. Certain
crafts had their regular dead season:<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> thus at Paris
among the bucklers (makers of brass buckles) the
<i>valets</i> were dismissed during the month of August;
but such holidays, probably unpaid, were rare, as was
also the arrangement to be found among the weavers
at Lunéville, which limited the amount of work a
journeyman might do in a day.</p>

<p>For various reasons it is difficult to state precisely
what wages were paid; there are very few documents;
the price of labour varied very much in different
crafts and at different periods; the buying power of
money at any given time is a difficult matter to determine;<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
and finally, it was the custom to pay a workman
partly with money and partly in kind. It must not
be forgotten too that a man ate with his master, a
decided economy on the one hand, and on the other
a guarantee that he was decently fed. Sometimes he
received an ell of cloth, a suit of clothes, or a pair of
shoes.<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> It has been stated that his wages (which were
paid weekly or fortnightly) were, in the thirteenth
century, enough for him to live on decently.<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> It has
been possible to reconstruct the earnings and expenditure
of a fuller at Léon in the year 1280; the inventory
of a soap-maker of Bruges of about the same date<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a>
has been published; it has been estimated that in
those days the daily wage of a <i>compagnon</i> at Aix-la-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>Chapelle
was worth two geese, and his weekly wage
a sheep; comparisons have been made, and it has
been concluded that a workman earned more in Flanders
than in Paris, more in Paris than in the provinces.
All this seems likely enough; but I should not dare
to generalize from such problematic calculations. I
limit myself to stating that historians are almost
unanimous in holding that, taking into consideration
that less was spent on food, rent, and furniture, and
above all on intellectual needs (because both the
demands were less and the prices lower), it was easier
for a workman&rsquo;s family to make both ends meet in
those days than it is now.</p>

<p>It is at any rate certain that a journeyman&rsquo;s salary
was sometimes guaranteed to him; this is shown by
an article of the regulations in force among the tailors
of Montpellier, dated July 3, 1323:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a master does one of his workmen a wrong in
connection with the wages due to him, that master
must be held to give satisfaction to the said workman,
according to the judgment of the other masters; and,
if he does not do this, no workman may henceforward
work with him until he is acquitted; and, in case of
non-payment, he must give and hand over to the
relief fund of the guild ten &lsquo;deniers tournois&rsquo; [of
Tours].&rdquo;</p>

<p>On the whole, then, in spite of the varying conditions
in the Middle Ages, it is not too much to say that,
materially, the position of the journeyman was at
least equal, if not superior, to that of the workman of
to-day. It was also better morally. He sometimes
assisted in the drawing up and execution of the laws
of the community; he was his master&rsquo;s companion
in ideas, beliefs, education, tastes. Above all, there
was the possibility of rising one day to the same social<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>
level. Certainly one paid and the other was paid,
and that alone was enough to set up a barrier between
the two. But where &ldquo;small&rdquo; industry predominated,
there was not as yet a violent and lasting struggle
between two diametrically opposed classes. Nevertheless,
from this time onwards, an ever-increasing strife
and discord may be traced.</p>

<p>First the privileges accorded to the sons of masters
tended to close the guilds and to keep the workmen
in the position of wage-earners; this gave rise to
serious dissatisfaction. Besides this, the masters
were not always just, as even their statutes prove.
Those of the tailors of Montpellier, which we have just
quoted, decreed that the workshops of every master
who had defrauded a workman of his wages should
be boycotted. These injustices therefore must have
occurred, since trouble was taken to repress them.
Still more acute was the dissatisfaction in towns
where the rudiments of &ldquo;great&rdquo; industry existed.
Strikes broke out, with a spice of violence. In 1280
the cloth-workers of Provins rose and killed the mayor;<a name="FNanchor_21" id="FNanchor_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a>
at Ypres, at the same date, there was a similar revolt
for a similar reason, viz. the attempt to impose on the
workmen too long a working day. At Chalon, the
king of France had to intervene to regulate the hours
of labour. Already the question of combination was
discussed, and the masters did their best to prevent
it. At Rheims in 1292 a decision by arbitration
prohibited alliances whether of <i>compagnons</i> against
masters or of masters against <i>compagnons</i>. This
already displays the spirit of the famous law which
was to be voted by the Constituent Assembly in 1791.<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span>
In the year 1280, in the <i>Coutume de Beauvoisis</i> by
the jurist Beaumanoir, the combination of workmen is
clearly defined as an offence<a name="FNanchor_23" id="FNanchor_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>&mdash;&ldquo;any alliance against
the common profit, when any class of persons pledge
themselves, undertake, or covenant not to work at
so low a wage as before, and so raise their wages on
their own authority, agree not to work for less, and
combine to put constraint or threats on the <i>compagnons</i>
who will not enter their alliance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The attempt to raise wages by combination was
condemned under the pretext that it would make
everything dearer, and was punished by the lord by
fine and imprisonment.</p>

<p>One can see in these and other symptoms signs of
the coming storm. The workmen protested against
the importation of foreign workers as lowering the
price of labour, and made them submit to an entrance
fee. They attempted to secure a monopoly of work,
just as the masters attempted to secure the monopoly
of this or that manufacture. Thus amongst the nail-makers
of Paris<a name="FNanchor_24" id="FNanchor_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> it was forbidden to hire a <i>compagnon</i>
from elsewhere, as long as one belonging to the district
was left in the market. Even in the religious brotherhoods,
which usually united master and workman at
the same altar, a division occurred, and in certain
crafts the journeymen formed separate brotherhoods:
the working bakers of Toulouse, the working shoemakers
of Paris, set up their brotherhoods in opposition
to the corresponding societies of masters, and this
shows that the dim consciousness of the possession of
distinct interests and rights was waking within them.<a name="FNanchor_25" id="FNanchor_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span></p>

<p>6. Finally we should take into account the condition
of the masters in the lesser guilds where the workshop
remained small, intimate, and homely, but these we
shall constantly meet with again when we come to
study the life and purpose of the guilds, since it was
they who made the statutes and administered them.
For the present it is enough to mention that women
were not excluded from guild life. It would be a
mistake to imagine that the woman of the Middle Ages
was confined to her home, and was ignorant of the
difficulties of a worker&rsquo;s life. In those days she had
an economic independence, such as is hardly to be met
with in our own times. In many countries she possessed,
for instance, the power to dispose of her property
without her husband&rsquo;s permission. It is therefore
natural that there should be women&rsquo;s guilds organized
and administered like those of the men. They existed
in exclusively feminine crafts: fifteen of them were
to be found in Paris alone towards the end of the
thirteenth century, in the dressmaking industry and
among the silk-workers and gold-thread workers especially.
There were also the mixed crafts&mdash;that is,
crafts followed both by men and women&mdash;which in
Paris numbered about eighty. In them a master&rsquo;s
widow had the right to carry on her husband&rsquo;s workshop
after his death. This right was often disputed. Thus
in 1263 the bakers of Pontoise attempted to take it
from the women, under the pretext that they were not
strong enough to knead the bread with their own hands;
their claims, however, were dismissed by an ordinance
of the <i>Parlement</i>. Another decree preserved to the
widows this right even when they were remarried to a
man not of the craft.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, in many towns, above all in those
where entry into a guild conferred political rights and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
imposed military duties, the women could not become
masters. Condemned to remain labourers, working
at home, and for this reason isolated, they appear to
have been paid lower wages than the workmen; and
certain documents show them seeking in prostitution
a supplement to their meagre wages, or appropriating
some of the raw silk entrusted to them to wind and
spin. But other documents show them as benefiting
by humane measures which the workwomen of to-day
might envy them. They were forbidden to work
in the craft of &ldquo;Saracen&rdquo; carpet-making, because
of the danger of injuring themselves during pregnancy.
This protective legislation dates from the
year 1290: for them, as for children, exhausting and
killing days of work were yet to come.<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> All the same,
one can see the tendency to keep them in an inferior
position for life, and, taken along with the strikes
and revolts, the first appearances of which amongst
weavers, fullers, and cloth-workers we have already
mentioned, this clearly shows that, side by side with
the half-democratic guilds which were the humblest,
there existed others of a very different type.</p>

<p><a name="CHAPTER_II_7" id="CHAPTER_II_7"></a>7. Directly we go on to study the great commercial
and industrial guilds profound inequalities
appear. Nor do these disappear with time; whether
we deal with the bankers&rsquo; or with the drapers&rsquo; guilds,
we find that their organization is already founded on
the capitalist system. The masters, often grouped
together in companies, are great personages, rich
tradesmen, influential politicians, separated from those
they employ by a deep and permanent gulf.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span></p>

<p>The river merchants of Paris, the Flemish and
German Hanse, the English Guild Merchants, and the
<i>Arte di Calimala</i> in the commune of Florence,<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> may
be taken as types of the great commercial guilds.
They were the first to succeed in making their power
felt, and represent, first by right of priority, and
later by right of wealth, all that existed in the way
of business, the <i>Universitas mercatorum</i>, and they
long retained an uncontested supremacy. Not only
the whole body, but the heads of the houses or societies
dependent on them, had numberless subordinates,
destined for the most part to remain subordinates&mdash;cashiers,
book-keepers, porters, brokers, carriers, agents,
messengers. These paid agents&mdash;often sent abroad
to the depots, branch houses, bonded warehouses,
<i>fondouks</i>, owned collectively or individually by the
wholesale merchants whose servants they were&mdash;were
always under the strictest regulations. Take, for
instance, the prohibition to marry which the Hanseatic
League imposed on the young employees whom it
planted like soldiers in the countries with which it
traded. Nor was the Florentine <i>Arte di Calimala</i>,
so called after the ill-famed street in which its rich
and sombre shops were situated, any more lenient to
those of its agents who, especially in France, were set
to watch over its interests. The merchants of the
Calimala&mdash;buyers, finishers, and retailers of fine cloth,
money-changers too, and great business magnates,
constantly acting as mediums of communication
between the West and the East&mdash;were far from treating
their indispensable but untrustworthy subordinates in
a spirit of brotherhood. They looked on them with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>
suspicion as inferiors. They complain of their &ldquo;unbridled
malice&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_28" id="FNanchor_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> they reproach them, and probably
not without reason, with making their fortunes at the
expense of the firms which paid them. It was decided
that in the case of a dispute as to wages, if nothing
had been arranged in writing, the master could settle
the matter at will without being bound by precedent
or by anything he had paid in a similar case. If the
employee was unlucky enough to return to Florence
much richer than he left it, he was at once spied upon,
information was lodged against him, and an inquiry
instituted by the consuls of the guild; after which he
was summoned to appear and made to disgorge and
restore his unlawful profits. If he could not explain
the origin of his surplus gains, he was treated as a
bankrupt, his name and effigy were posted up, and
the town authority was appealed to that he might be
tortured till a confession of theft or fraud was forced
from him; he was then banished from the Commune.
Thus we see exasperated masters dealing severely
with dishonest servants: capital ruling labour without
tact or consideration.</p>

<p>The autocratic and capitalistic character of the great
industrial guilds is even more striking.<a name="FNanchor_29" id="FNanchor_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p>The woollen industry offers the most remarkable
instances. The manufacture of cloth (which was the
principal article of export to the Levantine markets)
was the most advanced and the most active industry
of the Middle Ages, with its appliances already half
mechanical, supplying distant customers scattered all
over the world. It was the prelude to that intensity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
of production in modern times which is the result of
international commerce.</p>

<p>The wholesale cloth merchants no longer worked
with their own hands; they confined themselves to
giving orders and superintending everything; they
supplied the initiative; they were the prime movers
in the weaving trades which depended on their orders;
they regulated the quantity and quality of production;
they raised the price of raw material, and the workmen&rsquo;s
wages; they often provided the appliances for work;
they undertook the sale and distribution of goods,
taking the risks, but also the profits. Already they
were capitalists, fulfilling all the functions of captains
of industry.</p>

<p>What became, then, of the intimate and cordial
relations between masters, journeymen, and apprentices?
The guilds began to assume a character
unlike anything which could exist among the clothiers
or blacksmiths for instance. This new state of affairs
suddenly arose at Florence in the <i>Arte della Lana</i>. At
some periods of its existence this guild had a membership
of 20,000 to 30,000, but it was like a pyramid,
with a very large base, numerous tiers, and a very small
apex. At the summit were the masters, who were
recruited entirely from among the rich families and
formed a solid alliance for the defence of their own
interests. Forced to guard against the perils which
threatened their business on every hand&mdash;the difficulty
of transport, a foreign country closed to them by
war or by a tariff, the jealousy of rival towns&mdash;they
tried to recoup themselves by employing cheap labour,
and, remembering the maxim &ldquo;divide and rule,&rdquo; they
ranked the workmen they employed in different
degrees of dependence and poverty.</p>

<p>Some classes of workers, such as dyers and retailers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
were affiliated to the <i>arte</i> under the name of inferior
<i>membri</i>. True, they were allowed certain advantages,
a shadow of autonomy, and liberty of association,
but at the same time they were kept under strict rules
and under the vow to obey officers nominated by the
masters alone. Thus the dyers were not allowed to
work on their own account, and were subject to heavy
fines if the goods entrusted to them suffered the slightest
damage; the rate of wages was fixed, but not the date
of payment, which was invariably delayed.</p>

<p>On a lower tier came the weavers and the male and
female spinners; both classes were isolated home-workers
under the system of domestic manufacture,
which is highly unfavourable to combination and
therefore to the independence of the workers. The
weavers, whether proprietors or lessees of their trade,
could not set up without the permission of the masters
who held the monopoly of wool, on whom they therefore
became entirely dependent. They were pieceworkers
and had no guaranteed schedule of prices.</p>

<p>The spinners lived for the most part in the country,
and this country labour served, as usual, to lower
the rate of wages in the towns; perhaps this was why
the Florentine tradesmen favoured the abolition of
serfdom, for the reason that its abolition took the
peasants from the land and left them free but without
property, thus forcing them to hire themselves out,
and so creating a reserve army for the needs of industry.
The masters invented a curious method of keeping
the women weavers in their power. Every year the
consuls obtained pastoral letters from the bishops of
Fiesole and Florence, which, at Christmas, Easter,
Whitsuntide, and All Saints, were read in the villages
from the bishop&rsquo;s throne. In these letters the careless
spinner who wasted the wool which had been entrusted<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
to her was threatened with ecclesiastical censure and
even with excommunication if she repeated the offence.
An excellent idea indeed, to use the thunderbolts of
the Church for the benefit of the great manufacturers!</p>

<p>On a lower tier again we find the washers, beaters,
and carders of wool, the fullers and the soapboilers,
who formed the lowest grade of the labouring classes&mdash;a
true industrial proletariat,&mdash;wage-earners already
living under the régime of modern manufacture. They
were crowded together in large workshops, subjected
to a rigorous discipline, compelled to come and go at
the sound of the bell, paid at the will of the masters&mdash;and
always in silver or copper, or in small coin which
was often debased,&mdash;supervised by foremen, and placed
under the authority of an external official who was a
sort of industrial magistrate or policeman chosen by
the consuls of the <i>arte</i> and empowered to inflict fines,
discharges, and punishments, and even imprisonment
and torture. In addition, these tools or subjects of
the guilds were absolutely forbidden to combine, to
act in concert, to assemble together, or even to emigrate.
They were the victims of an almost perfect system of
slavery.</p>

<p>This short sketch shows how necessary it is to discriminate
between the various types of guilds. But,
however much they differed in their inner characteristics,
they shared many points of resemblance which
we must now proceed to examine.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE GUILDS</span></h2>

<p>The administration of the guilds was everywhere
almost uniform. The guild was a voluntary association
of men carrying on the same trade or allied trades and
pledging themselves by oath to defend their common
interests. It demanded of those who, in virtue of their
mastership, wished to belong to it, proofs of capability,
morality, orthodoxy, political loyalty, and often the
regular payment of a contribution. Once enrolled,
a member could not leave without first publicly
announcing his intention to do so, and discharging
any debts owing to the guild. He could be expelled
for any serious breach of its regulations or of the laws
of the state.</p>

<p>The association thus constituted was autonomous;
it was a moral and legal person; it could possess
wealth in lands, houses, money, or bonds; it could
contract, bargain, bind itself, appear in court through
representatives whom it nominated (syndics, proctors,
etc.). It had its guild halls, which were decorated
with its coats-of-arms. It had its banner, funds, seal,
and archives. It was, then, within the limits of its
jurisdiction, self-governing. Its constitution was semi-democratic
in the sense that the masters of whom it
was composed were looked on as possessing equal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
rights. The legislative power was in the hands of the
General Assembly, which made, or at least sanctioned,
the statutes and the revisions of the rules, and it is
remarkable that from one end of Europe to the other
identical formulae on more than one point are found;
the words relating to the subject of prohibition, for
example: &ldquo;Let none presume or be so bold as to....&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_30" id="FNanchor_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></p>

<p>No act of any importance pledging the whole guild
could be carried through without the advice and
ratification of the assembly. The interests involved
were, however, so complex, the business of such daily
occurrence, that it would have been impossible to
convoke the assembly on every occasion; it therefore
became necessary to create an organ of government, an
executive, and at the same time a judicial, power&mdash;in
other words, to nominate officers to act in the name
of the guild. The method of nomination varied in
every age and region. In most cases the election was
made directly by the masters alone, or indirectly by
electors whom they nominated; sometimes, but rarely,
the inferior <i>members</i> of the complex guilds, journeymen
of the simple guilds, took part, and a certain number
of those elected belonged to their group. In other
cases the nomination depended on the lord or on
some one to whom he had delegated his authority;
in others it was held by the municipal magistrates, as
at Toulouse; and in others again the resigning officials
nominated their successors or filled vacancies as they
occurred. In Italy there were complicated systems
in imitation of those in use for the communal magistracies.
The candidates&rsquo; names were proposed, and
accepted or rejected by acclamation or by secret ballots;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>
those approved were written on tickets which were
placed in sealed and padlocked bags. In this way a
supply of candidates was provided for several years,
and whenever necessary, a child or a priest drew at
hazard one of the names for each post.<a name="FNanchor_31" id="FNanchor_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> This curious
combination of chance and of popular choice was
often to be met with in the Italian Republics. At
Arras, in the butchers&rsquo; guild, as many balls of wax as
there were masters present were placed in an urn. The
words &ldquo;Jésus-Marie&rdquo; were inscribed on one of the
balls, and the man who drew it became head of the
guild.</p>

<p>In course of time the right to office was restricted
by an age limit, by a longer or shorter period of matriculation,
and even by wealth or social standing. Thus,
among the old-clothes dealers of Florence no one who
cried his goods in the streets, and among the bakers,
no one who carried bread from house to house on his
back or on his head, could be elected rector.</p>

<p>The officials thus nominated (and none could escape
the duty which fell to him) were sometimes quite
numerous; the <i>Arte di Calimala</i> at Florence had four
consuls, a treasurer or <i>camérier</i>, a cashier, a syndic,
and a proctor, not to mention two notaries and other
subordinate officers whom the consuls chose with the
assistance of a general council, and of a special council
of the guild. The heads or chiefs were called in the
south of France, <i>consuls</i>, <i>recteurs</i>, <i>bailes</i>, <i>surposés</i>, etc.;
those in the north were called <i>gardes</i>, <i>eswards</i>, <i>jurés</i>,
<i>prud&rsquo;hommes</i>, <i>maïeurs de bannières</i>, etc. In certain
texts one comes across &ldquo;bachelor&rdquo; masons and
carpenters, curious titles given to ex-officers, who,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
though they had resigned their headship, might still
have some official duties.<a name="FNanchor_32" id="FNanchor_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a></p>

<p>These officers were usually not long in power&mdash;sometimes
only a few months, and practically never longer
than a year; their duties ended with a statement of
accounts which carried with it ineligibility to re-election
for a certain time.</p>

<p>There was always a fear of creating magisterial
dynasties which might perpetuate themselves at will,
and of encouraging the development of cliques; for
these reasons several members of a family or business
house were not allowed to sit on the guild committee
simultaneously.</p>

<p>The reason why so much trouble was taken to divide
the responsibilities was because they conferred considerable
power and entailed a great deal of absorbing work.
The heads of the guilds, by whatever name they were
called, took an oath that they would first and foremost
see that the rules were carried out&mdash;no easy matter.
In this respect they had legal powers, and they not
only acted as arbiters in the quarrels which arose
among the members, but also in the conflicts which
in the great merchant guilds might arise in the course
of trade even with foreigners: disputes over weights
and measures, bankruptcies, frauds, reprisals, etc.
They were, in fact, public officials, and their consular
tribunals were to become in time the organs of the
Commune. In the industrial guilds they had to
watch over production, inspect the articles of manufacture
in the workshops, to make sure that they were
in conformity with the prescribed rules. In cases of
delinquency they had the right to seize and burn the
goods and to inflict a fine on the offenders. In some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
places it was their duty to protect the apprentices, to
examine the candidates for mastership, and to provide
the necessary funds for the pious works which were
under the control of the community.</p>

<p>At Florence the <i>Arte di Calimala</i> had the care of the
monastery of San Miniato, the baptistery of St. Jean,
and the hospital of St. Eusèbe; the <i>Arte della Lana</i>
took charge of the building and decoration of the
dome. In short, everything which could contribute
to the welfare and reputation of the guild was under
the jurisdiction of the heads, who, controlled by their
colleagues, had thus an extensive sphere of activity.</p>

<p>The consuls of the Calimala had among their duties
the maintenance of roads and hostels, and even the
safe conduct of Florentine travellers in a district
extending as far as the fairs of Champagne and St.
Gilles.</p>

<p>But it will be easier to judge of the multiplicity of
duties which the guilds demanded of their officers if
their aims are more closely studied, and this will
best be done by carefully investigating their guiding
principles as shown in their statutes.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_IV" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE AIMS AND METHODS OF THE GUILDS</span></h2>

<p>The guilds appear to have had three essential aims:
an <i>economic</i> aim, a <i>social and moral</i> aim, and a <i>political</i>
aim.</p>

<p>1. The economic aim comes first in time and
importance. The guild was first and foremost a
fighting organization for the defence of the trade
interests of those who belonged to it. It was jealous
both of the welfare and of the honour of the craft&mdash;two
things intimately connected; for it realized that good
reputation is one of the conditions of good business.
Naturally the first means to suggest itself for the
attainment of this double ideal was the regulation of
<i>production</i> and <i>sale</i>.</p>

<p>With regard to production, the guilds prided themselves
on giving an official guarantee to the consumer.
Hence the many articles contained in the statutes in
which they boast of their good faith,<a name="FNanchor_33" id="FNanchor_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> or make a point
of emphasizing the honesty of their trade dealings;
hence their complicated regulations, often so misunderstood
by historians, for the prevention of bad
work; hence the minute instructions prescribing the
number of vats into which the Florentine dyer was
to dip his materials and the quantity and quality of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
the colouring matters he was to employ; the size of the
meshes in the nets which the Roman fisherman was to
cast into the Tiber;<a name="FNanchor_34" id="FNanchor_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the length of the pieces of linen to
be woven by the Parisian spinner, regulated by that of
the tablecloths which covered the table of &ldquo;good King
Philip&rdquo;;<a name="FNanchor_35" id="FNanchor_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> or the colour and size of the garments which
the silk workers of Constantinople were to make.<a name="FNanchor_36" id="FNanchor_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a></p>

<p>In pursuance of the same principle, and on the
authority of the Statutes&mdash;intervention on the part
of the public authorities not being required&mdash;it was
strictly forbidden, under penalty of a fine or of expulsion,
to sell damaged meat, bad fish, rotten eggs,<a name="FNanchor_37" id="FNanchor_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
or pigs which had been fed by a barber-surgeon who
might have fattened them on the blood of sick people.<a name="FNanchor_38" id="FNanchor_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a>
The dyers pledged themselves to use nothing but fast
colours, furriers to use only skins which had not been
previously used, mattress-makers never to employ
wool coming from hospitals. The tailor who spoilt
a garment or kept a piece of cloth entrusted to him
was made to pay back his client and was punished by
his fellows. In Maine a butcher might not display a
piece of beef on his stall unless two witnesses could
testify to having seen the animal brought in alive.<a name="FNanchor_39" id="FNanchor_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a>
If by any chance an article passed through the hands
of two craft guilds, delegates from each had to assure
themselves that the rules of both had been faithfully
observed.<a name="FNanchor_40" id="FNanchor_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p>The guild prided itself on letting nothing leave its
shops but finished products, perfect of their kind;
it examined and stamped every article, and further
required that it should bear a special trade-mark
stating where it was made and its just price.<a name="FNanchor_41" id="FNanchor_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> At
Ypres, towards the end of the thirteenth century, the
pieces of cloth thus officially accepted numbered 8000
a year. Nor was this all; like Caesar&rsquo;s wife, the guild
must be above suspicion; not only fraud, but the
very appearance of fraud was rigorously excluded, all
that might deceive the buyer was forbidden. In
Florence jewellers might not use sham stones, even
if they declared them to be such;<a name="FNanchor_42" id="FNanchor_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> in Paris it was
forbidden to make glass jewels in imitation of real
stones, or to put a leaf of metal under an emerald to
give it an artificial brilliance;<a name="FNanchor_43" id="FNanchor_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> plated and lined goods
were not allowed, as they might be mistaken for solid
gold or silver.<a name="FNanchor_44" id="FNanchor_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> Once when a goldsmith, thinking no
harm, had made a bowl of this kind, it was decided,
after deliberation, to sell it secretly, and he was
cautioned never to make another.</p>

<p>Sale was as carefully watched over as production.
Not only had the weights and measures to be verified
and controlled in conformity with carefully preserved
standards, but at Florence, for instance, the &ldquo;iron
ruler&rdquo; of the <i>Calimala</i> was the standard for measuring
woollen materials, and there were besides minute
directions for measuring; there were prescribed
methods for measuring a piece of cloth, or for filling
a bushel with onions by placing the arms round the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
edge in order to add to the contents and ensure good
measure.<a name="FNanchor_45" id="FNanchor_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a></p>

<p>In &ldquo;great&rdquo; commerce the guild regulated the
conditions which made a bargain valid, the duty of
paying the <i>denier à Dieu</i>, and the earnest-money, the
regular term for completing payment, the rate of
discount, and the transparent methods of avoiding the
ban placed on interest by the Church,<a name="FNanchor_46" id="FNanchor_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> the methods
of book-keeping, etc. By means of these Statutes
commerce was eventually to emerge armed with full
rights; and as the failure of one member to fulfil his
undertakings might compromise all the others, we can
understand, even if we cannot approve, the severity
of the penalties inflicted on a bankrupt, the posting
up of his name and effigy, his expulsion from the guild,
his imprisonment and occasionally his banishment
from the city.</p>

<p>One serious result of this constant and perfectly
legitimate effort to assure the success of the guild
was that it produced a strong desire to reduce, or
if possible do away with, competition. The Middle
Ages did not understand rights except under the
form of privileges, and the guild always tended to
arrogate to itself the monopoly of the craft which it
carried on in a city. It even tried to exclude neighbouring
towns from the market, and this was the
secret of the desperate struggles which set at enmity
Bruges and Ghent, Siena, Pisa, and Florence, Genoa
and Venice, etc.</p>

<p>There is ample proof of this exclusive spirit. At
first the guilds tried to keep their processes secret, just
as to-day a nation makes a mystery of its new sub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>marine
or explosive. Woe to him who betrayed the
secret which gave the guild its superiority over the
others! He was punished by his fellows and by the
law. The merchants of the Calimala swore not to
reveal what was said in the Councils of the guild.
Florence owed part of her wealth to the fact that
for long she alone knew the secret of making gold and
silver brocade. A tragic example of what it might
cost to be indiscreet may be found in a Venetian law
of 1454: &ldquo;If a workman carry into another country
any art or craft to the detriment of the Republic, he
will be ordered to return; if he disobeys, his nearest
relatives will be imprisoned, in order that the solidarity
of the family may persuade him to return; if he
persists in his disobedience, secret measures will be
taken to have him killed wherever he may be.&rdquo; The
following is an example of the jealous care with which
the guild tried to prevent any encroachment on its
domain: in Paris the guild of the bird fanciers
attempted, though unsuccessfully, to prevent citizens
from setting on eggs canaries which they had caged,
as it injured the trade of the guild.<a name="FNanchor_47" id="FNanchor_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>It may well be imagined that guilds so jealous of
their prerogatives did not make it easy for merchants
and workmen coming in from outside. In the free
towns (i.e. towns in which industry was organised)
a master&rsquo;s licence obtained in a neighbouring, or
even a sister, town, was invalid, just as to-day the
diploma of doctor of medicine gained in one country
does not carry with it the right to practise in another.
To open a shop, it was necessary to have served an
apprenticeship in that city; or at the very least it
was necessary to have learnt the trade for the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
number of years demanded of the apprentices in that
district. The merchants who came from other parts,
not like birds of passage to disappear with the fairs, but
to settle down and establish themselves in a country,
were subject to the same dues as the citizens, but did
not share with them the franchise and might not join
their guilds. They formed colonies and attempted to
obtain, or even bought permission to reside and trade;
but they ran the risk of being arrested or turned out
at any moment, especially if they were money-lenders,
as, for instance, the Lombards, who both in France and
England many a time suffered from these intermittent
persecutions. Outsiders, even though in many cases
they had originally come from the district, were
hampered by all sorts of restraints and obligations.
In short, the town market was usually reserved for
the citizens of the town, and the policy of the guilds
(with occasional exceptions on the part of the great
commercial guilds) was to shut the door to all foreign
goods which they could produce themselves. Even
within the city walls it was their ambition to ruin,
or to force into their ranks, free lances of the same
trade;<a name="FNanchor_48" id="FNanchor_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> and although the word &ldquo;boycott&rdquo; was not
then invented, the thing itself already existed, and
was practised when necessary.</p>

<p>This tendency to preserve craft monopoly led to
other practices, and we find each guild jealously
guarding its particular province against all intruders.
Doubtless in those days an article was as a rule wholly
produced in a single workshop, but it sometimes
happened that an article had to pass through the hands
of more than one craft guild; this was the case with
cloth, leather, and arms. Sometimes, again, a craft
which began by being simple became so complex that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
its very development forced it to split up. Thus we
find in some large towns that the wine merchants were
subdivided into five classes: wholesale merchants;
<i>hôteliers</i> (hotel-keepers), who lodged and catered;
<i>cabaretiers</i> (inn-keepers), who served food and drink;
<i>taverniers</i> (publicans), who served drink only; and
<i>marchands à pot</i> (bottlers), who retailed wine to be
taken away. It followed that the dividing line between
guild and guild was often very doubtful, and this
situation was continually giving rise to differences,
quarrels, and lawsuits, some of which lasted for
centuries.</p>

<p>In one case<a name="FNanchor_49" id="FNanchor_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> we find a currier, who had taken to
tanning, forced to choose between the two trades; in
another we find goldsmiths forbidden to encroach on
the business of money-changing. Interminable disputes
dragged on between the tailors, who sold new
clothes, and the sellers of old clothes,<a name="FNanchor_50" id="FNanchor_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> and the courts
laboured for years and years to fix the exact moment
at which a new suit became an old one! The harness
makers quarrelled with the saddlers; the sword
polishers with the sword-pommel makers; the bakers
with the confectioners; the cooks with the mustard
makers; the woollen merchants with the fullers; the
leather-dressers with the shamoy-dressers; the dealers
in geese with the poulterers, etc, etc.<a name="FNanchor_51" id="FNanchor_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> When it was
not a question of the right of manufacture, they
quarrelled over the best pitches. At Paris the money-changers
of the Pont-au-Change complained that the
approach to their shop was obstructed by the bird<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>sellers,
and tried to force them to settle elsewhere.
The wheelwrights established in the Rue de la Charronnerie
(it might have happened yesterday) compelled
the clothes-sellers to move about with their hand-barrows,
instead of taking up their station in their
neighbourhood. These ever-recurring legal disputes
were inherent in the guild system and could only
disappear with the system itself.</p>

<p>Lastly, this competition for monopolies made itself
felt in the very heart of each guild. It led directly to
rigorous limitation of the number of masters. If, in
fact, all those who were qualified to receive mastership
had been left free to set up, those who first held the
privilege would have risked being lost in the crowd
of newcomers. This explains why even here they
sought to reduce competition to a minimum. Only
six barbers were allowed in Limoges, and when one of
them died, his successor was elected after a competitive
examination. At Angers the head of the guild only
created new master butchers every seven years, and
even then it was necessary to obtain the consent of
the other masters.<a name="FNanchor_52" id="FNanchor_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> In certain towns when a family
in possession of a craft died out, its house of business
and appliances reverted to the guild, which indemnified
the heirs.<a name="FNanchor_53" id="FNanchor_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> It was an expense, but it meant one
competitor the less. Is it to be wondered at that
mastership in many crafts gradually became hereditary?
It was only necessary to push the principle
a little further. If we consult the <i>Book of Crafts</i> drawn
up by Étienne Boileau from 1261 to 1270 by order of
Louis IX., we read in the Statutes of the napery
weavers of Paris: &ldquo;No one may be master weaver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
except the son of a master.&rdquo; Thus, from the thirteenth
century, guild organization, in the pursuit of its
economic ends, closed its ranks and tended to become
a narrow oligarchy.</p>

<p>2. The second ruling idea of the Guild Statutes was
the pursuit of moral and social aims; it desired to
establish between the masters of which it was composed
honest competition&mdash;&ldquo;fair play.&rdquo; It desired to prevent
the great from crushing the small, the rich from
ruining the poor, and, in order to succeed, it tried to
make advantages and charges equal for all. Its motto
so far was: Solidarity.</p>

<p>Thus, every member was forbidden to buy up raw
material for his own profit. If the arrival of fresh
fish, hay, wine, wheat, or leather was announced, no
one might forestall the others and buy cheaply to sell
dearly; all should profit equally by the natural course
of events. When a merchant treated with a seller
who had come into the town, any of his fellows who
happened to come in at the moment when the earnest-money
was paid and the striking of hands in ratification
of the bargain took place, had the right to claim a share
in the transaction and to obtain the goods in question
at the same price.<a name="FNanchor_54" id="FNanchor_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> Sometimes, in order to avoid
abuses, anything which had come within the city walls
was divided into portions and the distribution made
in the presence of an official (<i>prud&rsquo;homme</i>), who saw
that the allocation was just, that is to say, in proportion
to the needs of each shop or workshop.<a name="FNanchor_55" id="FNanchor_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> Often the
maximum amount which an individual might acquire
was strictly laid down. At Rome a mattress maker
might not buy more than a thousand pounds of horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>
hair at a time, nor a shoemaker more than twenty
skins. To make assurance doubly sure, the community,
when it was rich, undertook to do the buying for its
members. At Florence the <i>Arte della Lana</i> became
the middleman;<a name="FNanchor_56" id="FNanchor_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> it bought wholesale the wool,
kermes, alum, and oil, which it distributed according
to a uniform tariff amongst its members, in proportion
to their requirements; it possessed, in its own name,
warehouses, shops, wash-houses, and dyeing-houses,
which were used by all. Thus it came to carry out
transactions to the loss of the common funds but to
the profit of all the master woollen merchants. It
even helped the masters with any available funds by
financing them. Again, at its own expense, it introduced
new manufactures or called in foreign workmen.
Later on it even possessed its own ships for the
transport of the merchandise which it imported or
exported. It acted like a trust or cartel.</p>

<p>Still with a view to equalizing matters between
masters, the cornering of the supply of labour was
forbidden, and not only was it forbidden to tempt
away a rival&rsquo;s workmen by the offer of a higher wage,<a name="FNanchor_57" id="FNanchor_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a>
but as a rule a man might not keep more apprentices
than others, and the spirit of equality was carried to
such lengths on this point that at Paris,<a name="FNanchor_58" id="FNanchor_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> among the
leather-dressers, no master who employed three or
more workmen might refuse to give up one of them to
any fellow-master who had in hand a pressing piece
of work and only one, or no, <i>valet</i> to execute it.</p>

<p>For the same reason a workman might not complete
work begun by another man and taken away from him.
Even the doctors at Florence might not undertake<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
the cure of a patient who had already been attended
by a colleague; but this rule was repealed, no doubt
because it was dangerous to the patients.<a name="FNanchor_59" id="FNanchor_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>Again, it was forbidden to monopolize customers, to
invite into your own shop the people who had stopped
before a neighbour&rsquo;s display of goods, to call in the
passers-by, or to send a piece of cloth on approbation
to a customer&rsquo;s house.<a name="FNanchor_60" id="FNanchor_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> All individual advertisement
was looked on as tending to the detriment of others.
The Florentine innkeeper who gave wine or food to
a stranger with the object of attracting him to his
hostelry was liable to a fine.<a name="FNanchor_61" id="FNanchor_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Equally open to punishment
was the merchant who obtained possession of
another man&rsquo;s shop by offering the landlord a higher
rent. Any bonus offered to a buyer was considered an
unlawful and dishonest bait.</p>

<p>The formation within the guild of a separate league
for the sale of goods at a rebate was prohibited; prices,
conditions of payment, the rate of discount, and the
hours of labour in the workshops were the same for
all members. Privileges and charges had to be the
same for all masters, even when the masters were
women.</p>

<p>One feels that there was a desire to unite the masters
into one large family. So true was this that, in commercial
matters, not only was father responsible for
son, brother for brother, and uncle for nephew, not
only were the ties of unity strengthened at regular
intervals by guild feasts and banquets, but the ordinary
dryness of the statutes was redeemed by rules of real
brotherhood. The merchant or craftsman found in
his craft guild security in times of trouble, monetary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
help in times of poverty, and medical assistance in
case of illness. At Florence the carpenters and masons
had their own hospital. When a member died, shops
were shut, every one attended his funeral, and masses
were said for his soul. In short, within a single guild
all rivals were also <i>confrères</i> in the full and beautiful
sense which the word has now lost.</p>

<p>These rules of brotherhood were often accompanied
by moral and religious rules; the guild watched over
the good conduct and good name of its members.
To be proconsul in the <i>Arte</i> of judges and lawyers at
Florence, a man had to be respected for his piety, his
good reputation, his pure life, and proven honesty;
he must be faithful and devoted to the Holy Roman
Church, sound in body and mind, and born in lawful
wedlock. To be received as a master, it was necessary
almost everywhere to make a profession of the Catholic
faith and to take the oath, in order that heretics
such as the Patarini and Albigenses might be kept out.
Punishments were inflicted on blasphemers, players of
games of chance, and even usurers. It was obligatory
to stop work on Sundays and holidays, and to take
part with great pomp and banners unfurled in the feasts
of the patron saint of the town and of the guild, not to
mention a host of other saints of whom a list was given.
The statutes often begin by enumerating the alms it
was thought necessary to bestow on certain monasteries
and works of mercy and instruction which they
promised to support out of their funds.<a name="FNanchor_62" id="FNanchor_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>But in these works the guild was often duplicated
and supplemented by another institution connected
with it&mdash;the fraternity.</p>

<p>The fraternity appears to have been anterior to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
trade association in some places;<a name="FNanchor_63" id="FNanchor_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> but whether older
or younger it remained closely united with it. Born
in the shadow of the sanctuary, it had aims that were
fundamentally religious and charitable; it was always
under the tutelage of a saint, who, on account of some
incident taken from his mortal life, became the patron
of the corresponding trade. Thus, St. Éloi was patron
of the goldsmiths, St. Vincent of the vinegrowers, St.
Fiacre of the gardeners, St. Blaise of the masons, St.
Crespin of the shoemakers, St. Julien of the village
fiddlers, etc. Every fraternity had its appointed
church, and, in this church, a chapel dedicated to its
heavenly protector, in which candles or lamps were
kept burning. It celebrated an annual festival which
generally ended with a merry feast or &ldquo;<i>frairie</i>,&rdquo; as it
was still called in the days of La Fontaine.<a name="FNanchor_64" id="FNanchor_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> It joined
in processions and shared in the election of church-wardens.</p>

<p>Apart from the obligatory assistance at certain
offices and at the funerals of its members, the fraternity
owned a <i>chest</i>, that is to say, a fund maintained out
of the subscriptions and voluntary donations of the
members, as well as by the fines which they incurred.
Of these funds, collected from various sources, part
was given to the poor, to the hospitals, and to the
expenses of worship. Thus at Rennes the fraternity
of bakers ordained that in every batch of bread one
loaf of fair size should be set apart, called the <i>tourteau-Dieu</i>,
which brings to mind the portion for God or the
poor which it was the custom to reserve when the
king&rsquo;s cakes were distributed. In Alsace, again, in
the bakers&rsquo; fraternities, strict by-laws regulated the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
treatment of the sick in hospital;<a name="FNanchor_65" id="FNanchor_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> they were to be
given confession, communion, a clean bed, and with
every meal a jug of wine, sufficient bread, a good basin of
soup, meat, eggs, or fish; and all were to be treated alike.</p>

<p>The chest served also for supplying dowries to the
poor girls of the fraternity, which, it will be seen,
very much resembled a friendly society, but which, in
addition, sometimes took upon itself powers of arbitration,
as in the case of the furriers of Lyons.<a name="FNanchor_66" id="FNanchor_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> Sometimes
the fraternity coincided with the guild&mdash;that is,
all the members of the latter, including the journeymen,
took part in it; more often, however, it was merely
an affiliated institution, and membership was optional.
It is curious to find that it was not looked on with
much favour by the higher ecclesiastics or by royalty,<a name="FNanchor_67" id="FNanchor_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
perhaps because, not having the defence of trade
interests as its object, it attempted to dictate in Church
matters and was concerned with politics; perhaps
also because it increased the number of guild banquets
which easily degenerated into orgies and brawls.</p>

<p>This leads us to the relation between the guilds and
the public authorities, and to the part which they
played in the political life of the Middle Ages.</p>

<p>3. The guilds necessarily came into relation with the
authorities; they were far from being absolutely sovereign
communities, unrelated to the society around them.
They retained ties of dependence which reminded them
that their emancipation was both recent and incomplete.</p>

<p>In the first place it must not be forgotten that in
most cases they had extorted or bought from the lord
their earliest privileges. According to the feudal
conception, the right to work was a concession which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
he granted or refused at will, and it followed that he
kept the prerogatives of supervising and regulating
the guilds, whose existence he sanctioned and protected.
Thus at Rouen, towards the end of the twelfth
century, Henry II., King of England and Duke of
Normandy, sanctioned an association founded by the
tanners, with its customs and monopolies, giving as
his reason for so doing, the services which this industry
rendered him. At Étampes, at the beginning of the
thirteenth century, Philip Augustus of France made
known &ldquo;to all those, present and future, who should
read these letters&rdquo; that he permitted the weavers of
linen and napery to organize as they chose, and that he
exempted them from all obligations towards himself,
except the payment of the market toll, military service,
and a fine in case of bloodshed.<a name="FNanchor_68" id="FNanchor_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> He did this, he said,
for the love of God, which does not mean that he did
it gratis; for in return for their freedom these craftsmen
had to pay the king twenty pounds a year.</p>

<p>The lords maintained their authority everywhere
by exacting payment for the favours they granted.
They did not, however, always exercise this authority
directly, but often delegated it to their great officers.
The Parisian guilds were under the orders of the
provost of Paris, who was the king&rsquo;s agent and police
magistrate; and traces are to be found of the time
when craftsmen, living on the lands of the lord, were
grouped under the direction of a headman nominated
by him. In those days the nobles, who divided
between themselves the domestic services of his house,
naturally kept a firm hand over the craftsmen whose
duties were allied to their own. Thus at Troyes,
capital of the Court of Champagne, the bakers were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
under his <i>grand panetier</i>, the tapestry-makers and
<i>huchiers</i> under his <i>grand chambrier</i>, the saddlers under
the constable, etc., and a similar organization was to
be found in every feudal court. At Rome, every guild
had at its head a cardinal, who was its protector and
superintendent. But by degrees the power of these
dignitaries became nominal, till it was reduced to being
merely honorary and lucrative. They contented themselves
with the revenues brought in by their duties,
and with certain privileges attached to them. They
gave or sold the rights which their titles conferred
on them, to some private individual, usually to the
master of the guild, who, under the name of &ldquo;master
of the craft,&rdquo; really held the power.</p>

<p>In the free communities and in the free towns which
had become collective lordships the control, superintendence,
and direction of the crafts passed, by a
natural transference of power, to the municipal magistrates.
There were thus (and nothing was more
common in the Middle Ages than these ill-defined
situations) rivalries and struggles for jurisdiction
between the various authorities, from which the guilds
were never free.<a name="FNanchor_69" id="FNanchor_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a></p>

<p>The very fact that they had to reckon with neighbouring
and superior powers taught them to understand
that the possession of political rights was a means of
defending their economic interests, an indispensable
condition in the guidance of public affairs to their
own advantage. Accordingly, directly the towns freed
themselves, the guilds joined forces with all the lower
classes against lay or ecclesiastical feudalism. They
took an honourable part in the insurrection of the
Communes, and took their share also in the spoils of
victory. They won important liberties, and as each<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
guild formed a sort of little city in which the members
discussed, deliberated, and voted, a miniature republic
in which they received their civic education, they
quickly acquired an important place in the struggle
of parties and brought their influence to bear on the
government.</p>

<p>But the complexity of the situation demands a
double distinction. The political influence of the
guilds varied according to two main factors, the degree
of independence of the towns in which they existed, and
the nature of the crafts of which they were composed.</p>

<p>With regard to freedom, the towns ranged between
two extremes. There were those in which a power
external to the burgesses (king, lord, pope, bishop,
abbot) remained full of life, active, and capable of
making itself respected. Such was the case in France,
in England, and for a long time in Rome. There were
others, on the contrary, in which the burgesses almost
eliminated every element foreign to their class; in
which they absorbed the wealth and jurisdiction of
the bishop; in which they subdued the nobles and
forced them either to give up interfering or to become
plebeians by joining the guilds; in which they created
real republics with their own constitution, budget,
army, and mint, all the dangers and all the prerogatives
of practically complete sovereignty. Such was the
case in Florence, Venice, Ghent, Strasburg, and in the
imperial towns, which had nothing to fear from the
impotent or distant phantoms who claimed to be the
successors to Caesar and Charlemagne.</p>

<p>If they lived under the domination of an energetic
and neighbouring power, the guilds only took a secondary
place, and this is perhaps the reason why it has
been possible for the greater number of French
historians to leave them in the background; but they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
became powers of the first order if they developed in
surroundings where their expansion was not interfered
with.</p>

<p>Let us begin by considering them in those places
where they were held firmly in check. The authority
which weighed on them was exerted in several directions
at which we will glance.</p>

<p>In the first place, this authority attempted to
regulate the conditions of labour, to fix its hours and
its price. It forbade work on certain days, though it
is true that it consented to many exceptions. At
Rome, where religious festivals were naturally very
numerous, the Pope authorized the wine-sellers and
innkeepers to serve travellers, though not inhabitants
of the town, on such days; the farriers to shoe horses
on condition that they did not make new shoes; the
barbers to dress wounds but not to shave; the grocers
and fruiterers to open their shops without displaying
their goods; the butchers to hang their meat, so long
as it was covered up; the shopkeepers in general to
leave the doors of their shops half open for the sake
of ventilation.<a name="FNanchor_70" id="FNanchor_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> In other words, trade was allowed
<i>sub rosa</i>. The intervention of the lord in these matters
was so habitual that it caused no surprise. John II.
of France, in his famous ordinance of 1355, proclaimed
in 227 articles a maximum tariff for merchants&rsquo; goods
and the wages of the workmen. The Statute of
Labourers in England in 1349 had similar objects.</p>

<p>The authorities interfered also in judicial matters.
When there was a dispute between two guilds (and
this, unfortunately, was of frequent occurrence) the
case came under the jurisdiction of the lordly, communal,
or royal tribunal; in Paris the matter went<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
before the king&rsquo;s provost, and in case of appeal, to the
<i>Parlement</i>. But if the trade was held in fee, <i>i.e.</i> if it
was under the protection of a master who held it in fee,
it was he who settled the difference.</p>

<p>Thus long wars were waged between barbers and
surgeons; at first united in one body, they wished
later on to be separated; but the surgeons wanted to
keep the monopoly of surgical operations, and against
this the barbers protested. Now the head of the trade
was the king&rsquo;s barber and first <i>valet de chambre</i>; and in
1372 he inspired an ordinance, which reserved to the
barbers the right to &ldquo;administer plaisters, unguents,
and other medicines suitable and necessary for curing
and healing all manner of boils, swellings, abscesses,
and open wounds.&rdquo; This, however, did not prevent
the quarrel from lasting several centuries longer.<a name="FNanchor_71" id="FNanchor_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>There were many other causes which led to lawsuits.<a name="FNanchor_72" id="FNanchor_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
The guild might go to law with individuals over the
possession of a house or a field, or have difficulties with
the tax-collector. Often, too, the causes of dispute
lay within itself and arose between officers and masters,
who claimed to have been unjustly accused of wrong-doing.
In all these cases it was invariably the rule
to apply to the head of the craft or to the representatives
of the competent authority (provost or seneschal).</p>

<p>In fiscal matters, the guild had obligations from
which it could not escape. In the first place, the right
to work, collectively and individually, had to be paid
for. The first article of the statutes of the napery-weavers
of Paris was couched in those terms: &ldquo;No
man may be napery-weaver at Paris unless he buys
the right from the king.&rdquo; By the application of the
same principle the community had to pay a royalty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
to get its statutes approved, although this did not
always exempt a member from having to pay down
a sum in advance for permission to open a shop or
hang out a sign.<a name="FNanchor_73" id="FNanchor_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Usually the <i>tonlieu</i> and the <i>hauban</i>
were paid to the lord, though it must be clearly
understood that the king and town might take his
place; the <i>tonlieu</i>, which was paid in money, was
a sum levied on the sale of merchandise in proportion
to the amount sold; the <i>hauban</i>, which was a
payment in kind,<a name="FNanchor_74" id="FNanchor_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> exempted those who paid it from
the other charges falling on the craft; it seems to have
been a privilege which could be bought, or at least a
sort of mutual contract or exchange between payer
and paid. But the lord, apart from what he thus
put straight into his coffers, levied other indirect
charges on commerce and industry. If he had granted
to a guild (the river merchants, for example) the river
tolls, he reserved the right of free passage for everything
destined for his own use. He kept for himself a
certain number of lucrative monopolies.<a name="FNanchor_75" id="FNanchor_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> He had, in
the fairs and markets which he alone could authorize,
the right of first choice and purchase. He demanded
payment for his stamp on the weights and measures;
he taxed everything which entered or left his territory;
he claimed duties on the weight of goods, and on
the inspection of goods and of inns. Often these
rights of lordship were transferred by him to one
of his officers, whose services he remunerated in this
way. One curious example will suffice.<a name="FNanchor_76" id="FNanchor_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> The Paris<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
executioner was a great personage in those days; he
walked the streets clothed in red and yellow, and was
exceedingly busy, for he had to keep the gibbet at
Mont Lançon supplied with humanity&mdash;and it had room
for twenty-four victims; not to mention the pillories,
where the minor offenders were exhibited, and the
scaffolds on which the worst criminals were executed.
To recompense him for his grim services he had been
accorded important privileges, amongst others the
right of <i>havage</i>; that is to say, of every load of grain
taken to the corn market he claimed as much as could
be held in the hollow of the hand or in a wooden spoon
of the same capacity. Besides this, he collected a toll
on the Petit-Pont, duties on the sale of fish and watercress,
on the hire of the fish stalls surrounding the
pillory, and a fine of twopence-halfpenny per head on
pigs found straying in the streets.</p>

<p>These were by no means all the charges imposed
on the guilds. They had further to guarantee certain
public services. To the building guilds was assigned
the provision of safeguards against fire; to the doctors&rsquo;
and barber-surgeons&rsquo; guilds, the care of the sick poor
and of the hospitals; to all, or nearly all, the assessment
of certain taxes, the policing of the streets, and sometimes
the defence of the ramparts. In Paris, where the
nights were as unsafe as they were ill-lit, every guild
in turn furnished, according to its importance, a certain
number of men to patrol the streets and keep guard,
from the ringing of curfew to the break of day, when
the sergeant of the Châtelet sounded the end of the
watch. The same custom was to be found in most of
the free towns. A few guilds only were exempt from
keeping guard, either on account of their finances or
because it was considered that they had to render
other services. Such, for example, were the gold<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>smiths,
archers, haberdashers, judges, doctors, professors,
etc.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some guilds were under special
regulations, <i>e.g.</i> the provision guilds. The fear of
scarcity, owing to the frequency of bad harvests or
war and also to the permanent difficulty of communication
and transport, was a perpetual menace to the
towns. Their policy in this matter was nearly always
that of a besieged city. The consequent legislation
was, above all, communal, and was inspired by two
fundamental principles: first, that on the Commune
devolved the duty of seeing that the inhabitants were
healthy and well fed; secondly, that the Commune,
when it was short of money, had a convenient resource
in the taxation of the necessaries of daily life.</p>

<p>Thus the Commune wanted, above all, an abundance
of cheap provisions; it was anxious to avoid food
crises which are generally the precursors of riots and
even revolutions; and, without theorizing (nobody
troubled much about theories in those days) they
practised what a historian has called a sort of &ldquo;municipal
socialism.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_77" id="FNanchor_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> The Commune did not confine
itself to checking the exportation of cattle or of wheat
by strict prohibitions, to encouraging imports by giving
bonuses, and forbidding speculations and monopolies
under pain of severe punishments; it instituted the
public control of grain, owned its own mills and ovens,
filled public granaries at harvest time, and emptied
them when prices were high; and it did all this with
no idea of gain, but in order that the poor should not
be condemned to die of hunger when times were bad.
Sometimes the Commune owned fisheries and fish-markets
(Rome); it often held the monopoly of salt
(Florence); sometimes it forbade a family to keep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
more wine in the cellar than was needed, in order that
the possibility of using it should not be confined to the
rich. It was with this object in view that in the town
of Pistoria it was decreed that every owner of sheep
should supply at least twenty lambs from every hundred
sheep, and in the district of Florence, that every
peasant should plant so many fruit trees to the acre.</p>

<p>When the Commune did not go so far as to take on
itself the supply of actual necessaries, it achieved the
same end through the medium of the provision trades.
This is why the millers were the objects of endless
regulations intended to protect from fraud those who
gave them their grain to grind. This is why the bakers
were subjected to a municipal tariff, were closely
watched, and were sometimes obliged to put up with
the competition of outside bakers. This is why the
merchants sold vegetables, fruits, oil, and wine at
prices fixed by special magistrates. Besides this
perfectly legitimate endeavour to guarantee the
necessaries of life to every one as far as possible, there
was the very similar and no less justifiable attempt
to guarantee the good quality of provisions exposed
for sale. The <i>talmelier</i>, or baker, might not offer for
sale bread that was badly baked or rat-eaten.<a name="FNanchor_78" id="FNanchor_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> Provisions
for market were submitted to a daily and
rigorous examination. The butchers at Poitiers had
to undergo a physical and moral examination to make
sure that they were neither scrofulous, nor scurfy, nor
foul of breath, and that they were not under excommunication.
There was the curious office of the
<i>langueyeurs de porc</i>, who had to examine pigs&rsquo; tongues
to see if they showed any signs of measles or leprosy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span></p>

<p>Hygiene, little studied in those days, gave birth to
several precautionary measures. Indeed, it was necessary
to study it when epidemics were abroad, and
epidemics were both frequent and deadly. The
private slaughter-houses, and still more those of the
Butchers&rsquo; Guild, were periodically inspected and
moved out of the towns into the suburbs. The
numerous rules and dues which were imposed
on this rich guild, which, with its slaughterers and
knackers, formed a formidable and powerful company,
appear to have been balanced by considerable
privileges. At Paris, for instance, the Grande
Boucherie, as it was called, possessed a monopoly
extending to the suburbs, by which the masters,
reduced to a small number who succeeded one another
from father to son, had the sole right of selling or
buying live animals or meat, as well as sea and fresh-water
fish.</p>

<p>The constant relations between the craft guilds and
the authorities gave them a place of their own; but,
besides this, they led to the creation of guilds of an
entirely official character. The guilds of the measurers
(<i>mesureurs</i> and <i>jaugeurs</i>), who verified the capacity of
earthenware jars, barrels, bushels, etc., or of the
criers (<i>crieurs</i>), who cried in the streets the contents of
their jugs&mdash;wine for instance&mdash;and offered them to the
passers-by to taste,<a name="FNanchor_79" id="FNanchor_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> were in fact combinations of
government officials. These trades were peculiar in
this respect, that those who plied them were in receipt
of a salary out of their official takings, and that they
might not exceed a certain number; and also that they
held a monopoly, since every one was obliged to
employ them.</p>

<p>Through them we can pass to the second aspect of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
the communal or lordly legislation which regulated
the provision trades, viz. the fiscal aspect.</p>

<p>It was no longer in the interests of the consumer
that the Commune kept, for instance, the monopoly of
salt, buying as cheaply and selling as dearly as possible.
It was for its own benefit that it instituted customs,
dues, and tolls, levied on food-stuffs, which therefore
fell more heavily on the poor than on the rich; their
variation was simple&mdash;when the poorer classes had
their way the dues went down, when the rich were
in power they went up. Things are just the same
nowadays, in spite of the fine phrases with which
the fluctuations of commercial policy in great states
are disguised. But since, in speaking of guilds,
we have been led to speak of social classes, we
must now describe their classification in those centres
where the system was most fully developed,&mdash;that is
where guilds, instead of being subjects, were ruling
powers.</p>

<p>It naturally follows that their relations with the
authorities were greatly modified in the towns in which
they created, or were themselves, the authorities. Such
was the case at Florence, where, from the year 1293,
twenty-one <i>Arti</i> or unions of craft guilds nominated
the Priors and the other supreme magistrates of the
city; at Strasburg, where, during the fourteenth century,
the City Council was formed from the delegates of
twenty-five <i>Zünfte</i>, having the same constitution as the
Arti of Florence; at Ghent, where at about the time of
James van Artevelde the three <i>members</i><a name="FNanchor_80" id="FNanchor_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> of the State
were formed by the weavers, the fullers, and the
&ldquo;small&rdquo; crafts; at Boulogne, Siena, Bruges, Zurich,
Liége, Spire, Worms, Ulm, Mayence, Augsburg, Cologne,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
etc.; where within sixty years similar revolutions
occurred, putting the power into the hands of the
guilds.</p>

<p>In those days the guilds were the units for elections,
for the militia, and for taxation; they judged their
dependents without appeal; they expelled, or reduced
to the rank of passive citizens, those who were not
inscribed on their registers; they decided questions
of taxation, peace, and war, and directed the policy of
their town, whose internal and even external history is
essentially one with their own.</p>

<p>In these little corporate republics, the principal
question became that of deciding how the different
groups of guilds should apportion the government
among themselves. But first, on what principle were
the guilds classified? Was it according to the vital
importance of the needs they existed to supply?
This would seem reasonable enough, but apparently
it was nothing of the kind, or else the provision trades
would have been in the first rank. <i>Primum vivere</i>,
said the old adage, and to live it is necessary to eat
and drink, more necessary even than to be housed
and clothed, and to trade, and certainly more necessary
than to draw up notaries&rsquo; deeds or go to law. Now
the crafts which provided for the inner man, for Messer
Gaster, as Rabelais calls him (butchers, wine merchants,
bakers), were almost everywhere placed in the second
or third rank; the only exceptions were the grocer-druggists,
and it will be seen why this was so.</p>

<p>We must look elsewhere, then, for the reasons which
determined the order of social importance assigned
to the guilds by public opinion in the Middle Ages.
It appears that this classification was based on three
different principles which I will call the <i>aristocratic</i>, the
<i>plutocratic</i>, and the <i>historical</i>; that is to say, the status<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
of a profession seems to have depended on whether
it was more or less <i>honourable</i>, <i>lucrative</i>, or <i>ancient</i>.<a name="FNanchor_81" id="FNanchor_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>The place of honour was reserved for those crafts
in which brainwork took precedence over manual
work. They were regarded as more honourable
evidently because, in the dualistic conception which
governed Christian societies, spirit was placed above
matter, the intellectual above the animal part of
man. It was for this reason that the professions
which demanded brainwork alone were called from
that time onwards &ldquo;liberal,&rdquo; as opposed to manual
labour which was called &ldquo;servile,&rdquo; an expression
which the Catholic Church has piously preserved to
our own days.</p>

<p>At Montpellier, Boulogne, Paris, wherever universities
existed (which were themselves in effect &ldquo;guilds&rdquo;
or corporations, and were practically federations of
advanced schools, as we see from their jurisdiction,
their statutes, their dependents and agents whom they
possessed in the parchment makers and booksellers, and
in the title of rector which their head shared with
many other officers elected by the guilds), the professors
of the different Faculties enjoyed very extensive
privileges, and had the proud right of walking, like the
nobles, on the wall side of the pavement. At Florence,
where the division of the guilds into <i>greater</i>, <i>intermediate</i>,
and <i>lesser</i> bore witness to their hierarchy
before all the world, as there was no university, the
judges and notaries took precedence; the judges, who
were doctors of law, styled themselves <i>Messer</i>, like the
knights; the notaries called themselves simply <i>ser</i>, but
this served to distinguish them from the commoners.
The proconsul, or head of the corporation, went out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>
robed in scarlet, and was always escorted by two
gold-laced apparitors. In the first rank, too, were the
doctors, but the barber-surgeons, simply because they
performed operations, were relegated to a lower status;
artists, in spite of being often ranked among craftsmen,
gradually obtained social recognition.</p>

<p>Although architects were ranked with carpenters,
and image makers and sculptors were often ranked
with stonecutters, in many places the goldsmiths, who
included chasers, moulders, enamellers, and statuaries,
took a high rank. At Paris they were classed among
the <i>Six Guilds</i>, which, when the king, the queen, or
the papal legate made a solemn entry into the city,
enjoyed the coveted honour of carrying the blue
canopy under which the august personage advanced.
At Florence they belonged&mdash;as a sub-order it is true&mdash;to
the <i>speziali</i> (apothecaries), which also included the
painters and colour-merchants.</p>

<p>While the artists, when they were ranked among
the great guilds, only took a secondary and subsidiary
position, the bankers, money-changers, wholesale
traders, the great manufacturers (woollen merchants,
haberdashers, or furriers) lorded it over the others
with their wealth and splendour. This was, moreover,
to a certain extent, homage rendered to brains and
education. The exchange and the bank, where it was
necessary to make rapid and complicated calculations,
to transact business at a distance, and to do accounts
in differing coinages (and sometimes, even, without
coin), demanded varied knowledge and a certain
mental agility.</p>

<p>Wholesale commerce, which henceforward became
international, involved the power of taking long views,
quickness in grasping a situation, general aptitude,
and, in fact, qualities of mind and character which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
are not given to all.<a name="FNanchor_82" id="FNanchor_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The apothecaries had an
advantage in that they sold spices which had come
from distant lands. The trade in luxuries (furs and
silks) was also concerned with foreign articles and took
for granted a certain <i>savoir-faire</i>. &ldquo;Great&rdquo; industry,
for its part, demanded of those who carried it on, a
talent for setting in motion, directing, and co-ordinating
the complicated machinery of affairs or of men, and
this gift of organization is far from common.</p>

<p>However, it is easy to see that in the priority accorded
to the great industrial and commercial guilds,
the second of the principles we have mentioned was at
work, namely, that a craft was considered more or
less honourable according to the wealth it yielded.
Did the goldsmiths owe the respect which was shown
them more to their artistic skill than to the fact that
they were in the habit of handling jewels and precious
metals? It would be difficult to say. But it is very
certain that the bankers, money-changers, manufacturers
of cloth and silk, the dealers in furs and in
spices, and the haberdashers, who sold everything,
would not have been among the most favoured, if they
had not also been among the most wealthy. Thanks
to the crowns, ducats, and florins at their command,
they could indulge in a sumptuous style of living and
rival in luxury the lords of the land.</p>

<p>Like the latter they were in command of troops of
men; in their way they were captains; they united
the prestige of power with that of wealth. It was
undoubtedly for this reason that the butchers, who had
numerous assistants working under their orders and
who made considerable profits, sometimes managed
in Paris to be included among the <i>Six Guilds</i>, and at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
Florence headed the list of Intermediate Guilds. It
was for a similar reason that in the same town the
innkeepers and the stone and wood merchants, classed
among the Lesser Guilds, were called <i>grosse</i>;<a name="FNanchor_83" id="FNanchor_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> while
the small tavern-keepers and those who retailed wood
were not considered worthy of such a distinction.</p>

<p>The third principle&mdash;the historical&mdash;was active in
its turn. The later crafts, recently specialized, suffered
from the competition of work done in the home from
which they were imperfectly separated. If the butchers
did not succeed in taking their place definitely among
the Six Guilds of Paris, or in becoming affiliated to the
Greater Guilds of Florence, it is probably because, for
many years, the people were their own butchers, and
the fatted pig or calf was killed at home; in other
words because their field of action was an integral
part of domestic industry. The same may be said of
bakers and bread-makers; many peasants had their
own oven in which they baked their bread,<a name="FNanchor_84" id="FNanchor_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> and they
held stubbornly to this right which they sometimes
insisted on having solemnly recognized. There is no
need for further explanations to make us understand
why the bakers and bread-makers at Florence came
last on the list of the twenty-one official guilds. It is
useless to attribute their comparative disrepute<a name="FNanchor_85" id="FNanchor_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> to
the supposed ease with which they could defraud their
clients in the weight and quality of the bread they sold.
Unfortunately, the same suspicions might have been
applied to many others. Can it be forgotten that,
at Rome, the fishmongers were compelled to use scales
with holes in them like skimmers, so that the water
could run off and not add weight unfairly!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus on account of one or another of these three
principles, &ldquo;small&rdquo; crafts and &ldquo;small&rdquo; commerce
were far from attaining the level to which the great
guilds rose; and in those days the organized world of
labour was divided, sometimes into three groups, as
at Florence, Perpignan,<a name="FNanchor_86" id="FNanchor_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> or Ghent, sometimes into two,
as at Zurich, and sometimes into a greater number.
It is impossible to go into the details of the prolonged
struggles between these unequal groups, of their efforts
to maintain the balance among themselves, or to rule
one over another, or of the alternate victories and
defeats which they sustained. Nearly two centuries&mdash;from
the middle of the thirteenth to the middle of the
fifteenth&mdash;are filled with the unrest caused by these
quarrels which broke out in two or three hundred towns
at once, and which, in view of the absence of dependable
information concerning them, appear at a distance
utterly chaotic. All we can do is to indicate the
development which followed.<a name="FNanchor_87" id="FNanchor_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a></p>

<p>Immediately upon the victory of the lower classes
over lay and ecclesiastical feudalism&mdash;the first act
accomplished by the communal revolution&mdash;the power
passed to the rich burgesses. Aristocracy of money
naturally succeeded aristocracy of birth. This plutocracy
was represented by the great merchant guilds,
whose rise was soon followed by that of the great
industrial guilds, destined in some cases to supplant
them, but more often to remain their faithful allies.
At Florence, the <i>Arte di Calimala</i> which included
bankers and finishers and sellers of foreign cloth, was
at first the most important of all; it was later dethroned
by the <i>Arte della Lana</i>, composed of cloth manufacturers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
but both were included in the federation of the Greater
Guilds, which kept in its own hands the direction of
affairs. At Brussels and at Louvain seven families
long furnished the aldermen; at Ghent thirty-nine
<i>nouveaux riches</i>, and at Amiens an oligarchy of several
families, monopolized the direction of communal affairs.
Everywhere wool-merchants, money-changers, and
goldsmiths became important in proportion to their
wealth, not to their numbers. At Beauvais of thirteen
&ldquo;peers&rdquo; who constituted the municipal administration
seven were nominated by one guild&mdash;that of
the money-changers; the other twenty-one guilds
nominated six.</p>

<p>In short, what happened in the free towns was what
usually happens in such a case, namely what happened
in France in the nineteenth century. The victorious
bourgeoisie wanted to keep to themselves the spoils
of victory; they attempted to keep the lower classes&mdash;their
allies of yesterday&mdash;in a precarious and subordinate
position, and not only excluded them from the
magistracy, but stamped all politics with a strongly
plutocratic character. They sold to or reserved for
themselves all lucrative posts; they administered the
finances according to their own ideas without giving
any account of their actions; they multiplied wars to
kill inconvenient competition, or to open up new
outlets for their commerce. As all this entailed enormous
expense they resorted to loans which brought
in high and steady interest, and to taxes on objects of
daily consumption&mdash;reactionary taxes which demanded
an equal sum, and therefore an unequal sacrifice, from
rich and poor. They despised and oppressed the
small craftsmen and the small retailers; they tried to
limit or to suppress their right to combine or hold
public meetings, and of course they were still harder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
on all that labouring population which was not admitted
to the guilds, or which at least was only admitted
in a subject capacity. We have already seen (<a href="#CHAPTER_II_7">Chapter
II. 7</a>) how they organized the first form of capitalist
supremacy.</p>

<p>The second act of the revolution now began. The
town population divided itself into two separate
groups, which soon became two opposing parties: the
rich and the poor; the <i>fat</i> and the <i>lean</i>; the great and
the small; the good and the bad, as the chroniclers,
who usually belonged to the leisured class, said with a
certain savage naïveté. The crafts which claimed to be
honourable were set in opposition to those which were
considered low and inferior, and were supported and
urged on by the masses, who, without rights or possessions,
lived from day to day by hiring out their labour.</p>

<p>The fight was complicated by the capricious intervention
of the nobles or clergy who, sometimes by a
natural affinity, joined the aristocracy of wealth;
sometimes, in the desire to get the better of the great
burgesses who kept them out of the government,
allied themselves to the lower classes and made the
balance turn in their favour.</p>

<p>At certain times (this also is a law of history) the
lower classes, in despair at never getting anything out
of a selfish and implacable bourgeoisie, put their
confidence in some soldier of fortune, some ephemeral
dictator, some &ldquo;tyrant&rdquo; in the Greek sense, who
defeated their enemies and secured them a little well-being
and consideration. On other occasions it was
the rich burgesses who, frightened by the claims of
the people, called on some foreign or military power
to reduce the populace to order. Thus, by separate
roads, the republics and towns were travelling towards
monarchy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Before they reached this point, however, the &ldquo;small&rdquo;
crafts had their days of supremacy, which were characterized
by a peaceful policy, fiscal reforms, and the
effort to make taxation just through the progressive
taxation of incomes. They raised with themselves,
out of the darkness and degradation into which they
had fallen, the ragged and barefooted labourers
(carders, porters, <i>blue-nails</i>, as the Flemish labouring
classes were called in derision), proletarians, wage-slaves,
who in their turn desired political rights, a
legal status in the city, a rank among the guilds, a
share in the direction of the Commune.</p>

<p>In the year 1378 this movement seems to have been
at its height.<a name="FNanchor_88" id="FNanchor_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> A wave of revolution passed over
Europe at that time, and at Florence as at Ghent, at
Siena as at Rouen, in Paris as in London, for several
years, months, and sometimes weeks, Ciompi, Chaperons
blancs, Maillotins, etc., made the ruling classes tremble
for fear of union on the part of all this riff-raff. As a
Flemish chronicler expresses it: &ldquo;An extraordinary
thing was to be seen in those days; the common
people gained the supremacy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Their victory was short-lived. All the conservative
forces combined against the intruders. The attempt,
not to destroy but to reform and enlarge guild administration,
to make the whole world of labour enter
into it, was shown to be powerless; perhaps because
the workmen and men of the &ldquo;small&rdquo; crafts did not
clearly perceive what could give them freedom, or
know how to unite into a cohesive body; perhaps, also,
because the idea of hierarchy was still too strongly
rooted in society; finally, perhaps because there was
a fundamental contradiction between the administra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>tion
of the closed guilds which stood for privilege, and
the ideas of equality which tried to force an entrance
into them.</p>

<p>Whatever may have been the cause, from this
culmination they descended again towards their
starting-point, the supremacy of money and of the
great commercial and industrial guilds which no longer
allowed their power to be shared by the Lesser Guilds.
However, they stopped half-way. The preponderance
was not restored either to the prelates or to the
lords, neither did it remain with the lower classes.
It was too late for the great, too early for the small.
It remained and was consolidated in the hands of two
powers, each of which relied on the other&mdash;the middle
classes and the monarchy, the latter being represented
in the great states by royalty and elsewhere by princes
who might be <i>condottieri</i> or upstart bankers. Florence
went to sleep under the enervating and corrupt rule
of the Medicis. An ever-narrowing merchant oligarchy
governed Genoa, Venice, and the towns of the Teutonic
Hanse. Flanders was quiet under the authority of the
Dukes of Burgundy and of its opulent guilds, to which
craftsmen were no longer admitted. Towards the
middle of the fifteenth century the great epoch of the
free towns was over, and the glory of the guilds went
with them.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, while their restless and busy life
lasted they had their days of greatness, heroism, and
glory. Sometimes, as at Courtrai, they gained victories
over armoured knighthood. They did better. In the
neighbourhood of their cities they built roads, canals,
and seaports. Within the city walls they gave a splendid
impetus to architecture. They built monumental halls
like those of Bruges, fountains, hospitals, and public
promenades; they erected churches which were popular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>
palaces, town halls which were carved like fine lace and
flanked by towers and belfries from which the Tocsin
called the citizens to arms or to the assembly. They had
pride and patriotism, and also desired to honour the
profession which was for each of them a state within
the state. They contended for the honour of giving
a picture, a statue, or a tabernacle to the buildings
which thus became the incarnation of the soul of a
whole people. The traveller who visits Florence
admires the bas-reliefs half-way up the Campanile
attributed to Giotto, which represent the origin of
arts and crafts in the earliest ages of mankind; it is
the stamp and blazonry of the working classes on their
common work. Guilds have passed away, as all human
institutions must pass, imperfect and frail in their
very nature; but before their passing they realized a
great part of their high ideal, which, in its many
aspects, I have tried to make plain.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V</a><br />
<span class="smaller">THE MERITS AND DEFECTS OF THE GUILD SYSTEM</span></h2>

<p>We are now in a position to estimate the merits and
defects of the guilds before they fell into decadence
and decrepitude.</p>

<p>It is necessary to consider separately the two types
of guilds which we have described; for although they
had characteristics in common, they present more
differences than resemblances. Let us see, then, how
each acted on production and sale, and on producers
and sellers.</p>

<p>The guild system in the &ldquo;small&rdquo; crafts was at once
a guarantee of, and a check on, production and sale.
It endeavoured to insure and guard the consumer
against adulteration, falsification, and dishonesty;
to stamp goods with the character of finish, solidity,
and relative perfection, thus giving to them something
personal and therefore artistic; to keep within reasonable
limits the profits of the manufacturer, who was
also the merchant. On the other hand, the manufacturer
only dealt with small quantities, was content
with a very restricted clientèle, and aimed at nothing
beyond the local market without much chance of
either making a fortune or being ruined. Production
thus had but little vigour, and what was more serious
still, its plasticity was interfered with. The statutes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
which regulated it resembled feudal castles, which
protected but imprisoned those whom they sheltered.
The manufacturer, hampered by the restrictions
which surrounded him, could make no progress.
Industry, bound down by directions which were too
precise, too detailed, too authoritative, could not
adapt itself to the many caprices of fashion or to the
changes of taste which are the very life of human
civilizations; its forms were set, its methods petrified.
Invention could not have free play; it was accused
of outraging healthy tradition; it was considered
dangerous to set out to create anything new. In Florence
in 1286<a name="FNanchor_89" id="FNanchor_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> a cooper complained of being boycotted
by his guild because in making his barrels he bent
his staves by means of water, which was, he said, an
advantage to all who bought them. At Paris<a name="FNanchor_90" id="FNanchor_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> it was
forbidden to mould seals with letters engraved on them;
apparently the counterfeiting of seals and coins was
feared. Who knows, however, whether this prohibition
did not retard by a hundred years the invention of
printing, to which&mdash;when a method of making them
movable had been discovered&mdash;these engraved letters
gave birth?</p>

<p>With regard to producers and sellers, we may go
back to the simile of the strong castle. An instrument
of defence for those who were within the guild
easily degenerated into one of tyranny for those who
were without. It was the centre of an ardent and
exclusive corporate spirit. It resolved all the individual
egoisms of its members into a great collective
egoism. It is only necessary to recall the quarrels with
neighbouring guilds, and the hostility shown towards
workers who were not enrolled. To the masters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
which it was composed it ensured at least a modest
and honest livelihood, the just remuneration of labour,
or, one might almost say, to use a modern formula, the
whole product of labour. It even assured a refuge
against misery and distress, the certainty of assistance
in times of trouble, illness, old age, or misfortune. The
fishermen of Arles were bound to give one another
mutual assistance in stormy weather;<a name="FNanchor_91" id="FNanchor_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> in Paris
among the goldsmiths one shop remained open every
Sunday,<a name="FNanchor_92" id="FNanchor_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> and the money from the sales was divided
among the needy of the town and the widows and
sick of the guild. Fines were often used in this way.
The guild sometimes even gave to the travelling workman
who found himself at the end of his resources the
means of going in search of work elsewhere. The
guild secured to its members other advantages no less
coveted: a good position in public processions and
ceremonies when state dress was worn, or even at the
melancholy solemnities of the public executions;<a name="FNanchor_93" id="FNanchor_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> at
Lyons, at the time of the feast of St. John, two furriers
with lighted torches paraded to the church door,
mounted on two white mules, and at the entrance were
received by the cross and the canons.<a name="FNanchor_94" id="FNanchor_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> But more than
all this, the guild was not only a great family for those
who belonged to it, it was a little self-contained city,
a diminutive commune which the members administered
at will, and thereby prepared themselves for civic
life and its duties; it was a training-ground for independent,
well-informed, active citizens, who, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>
their parliamentary traditions, republican sentiments,
and democratic hopes, formed, with their fellow-craftsmen
of other crafts, a proud, practical, and
courageous middle-class, as anxious to defend their
town from outsiders as to beautify and adorn it.</p>

<p>Journeymen and apprentices shared in these honourable
privileges, and did not suffer unduly from the
inequality imposed on them, tempered as it was by
simplicity of manners and by the thought that it was
only temporary.</p>

<p>The guilds of &ldquo;great&rdquo; commerce and of &ldquo;great&rdquo;
industry also had their fine sense of honour, their
complicated regulations, their exclusive spirit. But
what distinguished them was the fact that their capital
was large and that they dealt with a vast market;
consequently, while the former were busy with exchange
and transport, traversed land and sea with their
convoys, and constituted themselves the carriers and
brokers of the world, the latter intensified production;
they possessed workshops which for those days were
very large, and, in order to lower their general expenses,
were interested in new inventions, and willingly
adopted mechanical methods; at Florence, for example,
metallic carders, which were still prohibited in Great
Britain in 1765, were already in use under the guild
system. Banking, commercial and maritime law, the
science of finance, the art of production on a large
scale and of securing international relations certainly
owe a great deal to these merchants and manufacturers,
who were the precursors of modern capitalists.</p>

<p>The members of these powerful guilds amassed
enormous fortunes, built themselves superb palaces,
became counsellors and money-lenders to kings, towns,
or popes. Sometimes they were too adventurous in
their speculations and their bankruptcies made a wide<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>
stir. Accustomed to affairs of the highest importance
and to court intrigues, they became diplomats, clever
politicians, who willingly took their share in government;
nor was it by chance that the first man in France
who tried to reform the kingdom according to the views
of the Third Estate was Étienne Marcel, provost of
the richest Parisian guild. Often, however, these
great burgesses were of an aristocratic spirit. In the
city they opposed the rise of the lower classes, and, in
their magnificent palaces, princes in fact before they
were princes in name, as the Medicis became, they
gradually extinguished around them the love of liberty
and of republican virtues. At the same time they
broke up that solidarity which was the very soul of the
primitive guilds; they created a social system which
perpetuated riches above and poverty below; they
enslaved and cruelly exploited the clerks and workers
they employed, their attitude towards whom was no
longer that of masters towards journeymen or <i>compagnons</i>,
but that of lords towards dependents. In a
word, they broke from the conditions which no longer
sufficed for the realization of their ambitions, and they
were preparing, indeed they were already developing,
an organization of labour which anticipated the future.
They were the agents of that profound change which
slowly brought about the death of the guilds.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI</a><br />
<span class="smaller">EXTERNAL CAUSES OF DECAY</span></h2>

<p>A body of institutions, like a living body, begins by
passing through a period of formation, growth, and
consolidation, after which decay inevitably follows;
it becomes feeble, disintegrates, decomposes, and
finally dissolves. Death is thus presented as the
natural term of life with its constant wear and tear,
as the necessary end of the spontaneous development
peculiar to living beings. But it is also determined
by the pressure of outside forces, by the action of
environment. Thus the guild system held within itself
elements of dissolution, and at the same time met
with destructive forces from without; it declined and
decayed under the combined influences of internal and
external causes.</p>

<p>It seems fitting to begin with the external causes,
since these were the most important. In an unchanging
environment living beings could exist for long
unchanged, but the changes ever at work without
hasten changes within, from the very fact that the
organism is itself at work. Thus it was that the guilds
were first of all affected by the profound changes going
on around them. The sphere in which they had to
work was both extended and modified. We must
follow out the consequences of both these changes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span></p>

<p>1. <i>The Extension of the Market and its Results.</i>&mdash;The
fifteenth century saw the formation of the great
States in Europe. France, which felt herself to be a
nation when she was trampled under foot by the
English, was the first to become a unity, and for several
centuries drew her power and her greatness from the
start which she thus gained. Spain was concentrated
under the authority of Ferdinand and Isabella.
England, worn out after a terrible civil war, found
rest under the Tudor dynasty. In Germany, which
was still very divided, the Hanseatic League included
twenty-four cities. Even in Italy the restless
republics, ever jealous of their independence, were
absorbed into larger territories and placed under a
common supremacy. Everywhere the endless subdivision
of the Middle Ages gave place to larger
groupings, possessing fuller life and wider interests.
Hence a new situation arose for the cities; among those
which in every state had up till now been on an equal
footing one rose to be the capital, the others, with
diminished prestige and importance, were only
secondary centres. They also ceased to be islets
where the people lived lives apart; from henceforward
they formed an integral part of a whole which
surrounded them and no longer allowed of a proud
isolation; they could no longer treat their neighbours
as foreigners or enemies; they found themselves
bound together by the necessity of obeying the same
laws and the same sovereign.</p>

<p>It followed that <i>city economy</i>, becoming narrow and
exclusive, grew difficult and by degrees impossible.<a name="FNanchor_95" id="FNanchor_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
It was replaced by <i>national economy</i>. This meant that
the commercial market, instead of being confined to
the inhabitants of a town and its suburbs, included<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
henceforth the province, the duchy, and by degrees
the whole kingdom. Above all, it meant that the
central power no longer legislated for people enclosed
within a small area, but that it attempted to unify
over the whole surface of a considerably enlarged
territory the official language, moneys, weights and
measures, as well as the regulations of industry and
the judicial forms; that it suppressed as far as possible
the tolls which obstructed the roads and rivers; that
it carried back to the frontier the barriers which had
been set up on the boundaries of every little domain;
that for a localizing spirit it substituted the desire to
reconcile the interests of the different regions between
which it played the part of arbitrator and peacemaker.</p>

<p>Doubtless the economic policy adopted by the great
States did not sensibly differ from that practised in the
towns. A system does not disappear without bequeathing
traditions and customs to its successor. National
economy copied the methods of city economy. When
Colbert, for instance, tried to realize for France the
ideal of self-sufficiency, when for this reason he wanted
to sell as much as possible and buy as little as possible
abroad, to create industries which were lacking, to
prevent those which existed from leaving the country,
to encourage the export of manufactured goods while
watching over their proper manufacture, and to hinder
the import of similar goods by barricading the country
with customs tariffs, he was only taking up once more
and making general an old system formerly tried by
Florence or Venice and adopted later by kings and
ministers in France and England, by Henry IV. and
notably by Richelieu. This mercantile system has
been christened Colbertism, and the name will serve
provided that it is known that Colbert was not its
father but its godfather.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span></p>

<p>Nevertheless, in spite of the continuity of the
principles which guide great governors, the mere fact
that the enlarged area in which the guilds operated
contained several towns whose jealousy might be
measured by their rights, was a terrible blow for the
guilds; each town with its narrow boundaries, finding
itself completely out of harmony with the world in
which it was condemned to live, had to adapt itself
to the new conditions or die.</p>

<p>Not only, however, had the internal markets grown
larger, the external market had also extended enormously,
and it was no longer for the spices and gems
of the Levant alone that ships and caravans set out.
In the South, Vasco da Gama had discovered the route
to the Indies; in the West, Christopher Columbus, while
seeking those same Indies, had come upon America;
in the North, Russia and Scandinavia had proved to
be magnificent fields for traders to exploit. Africa,
which as yet no one had dared to penetrate, was
approached and the existence of Oceania suspected.
Europe, in revenge for old invasions, overflowed
in her turn into other continents; she expanded
into distant colonies; the sun no longer set on her
possessions.</p>

<p>The first result was a rearrangement of commercial
routes, a formidable rush to the West. The Mediterranean
basin, cut off from the East by the Turks, ceased
to be the meeting-place of nations and the universal
centre of commerce. Genoa and Florence, the mothers
and glorious victims of Columbus and Amerigo Vespucci,
began to decay, and the very source of their wealth
was assailed by the discoveries of their children.
Beneath the trappings of gold and silk that yet covered
them there was left only the melancholy glory of their
dying prosperity. Venice the rich, Venice the beauti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>ful,
slumbering in the fever-laden air of her canals
from which the life was ebbing, slowly died in her
gorgeous setting of palaces and churches and degenerated
into a city of dreams, luxury, and pleasure, where the
leisured and the gay came to seek the shadow of a
great past and the splendours of a half-oriental civilization.
Many cities, like Pisa or Siena, deserved with
Bruges to be called &ldquo;the dead,&rdquo; cut off from the ocean
by the encroaching sands and from liberty by the
Spanish lords of Flanders.</p>

<p>How could the guilds hope to escape from the consequences
of misfortunes which struck at their very
roots? An even graver menace threatened them. To
take advantage of the new outlets, to satisfy a clientèle
henceforth scattered over the most diverse countries,
it was necessary to produce more, and to produce more
it was necessary to produce in a different way. Production
was transformed to meet the needs of trade.
Capitalism, which had hitherto been confined to a few
towns, received an impetus and developed with unexpected
vigour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great&rdquo; commerce, which spread over an immense
area, created exchanges and banks, and great financial
institutions for the circulation of capital; it formed
great companies which undertook to exploit the resources
of new countries; it accelerated transport and
built up in the press a valuable instrument for the
spread of information and for advertisement. In its use
of credit it no longer encountered the displeasure of the
Church, which, together with civil law, became reconciled
to loans on interest and recognized the practice as long
as the rate was moderate. Its coffers, filled with the
gold and silver of the galleons which came from Mexico
and Peru, gave Europe a hint of a hitherto unsuspected
danger&mdash;the glut of money. Capital, too, which had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
accumulated in the landlords&rsquo; and merchants&rsquo; chests,
took a leading part in business activities by reason of
its power to command; it became a moving force.</p>

<p>Henceforward, as we have already seen in the case of
the woollen merchants, three functions, hitherto united
in the person of the small craftsman of the towns,
became separated: those of the <i>merchant</i>, who bought
raw material and sold finished goods; of the <i>manufacturer</i>,
who possessed the appliances of labour; and of
the <i>workman</i>, who wrought with his own hands. Three
classes of men answer to this specialization at the
present day: the <i>traders</i>, who are not producers, but
act as middlemen between producer and consumer,
deciding what shall be produced and concerning themselves
solely with buying and selling; the <i>industrial
capitalists</i>, who, at the tradesmen&rsquo;s orders, direct
the transformation of the raw materials entrusted to
them, in workshops and with machinery which are
their property; finally the <i>workmen</i>, who, mere wage-earners,
carry out manual or mechanical work as they
are told.</p>

<p>These three classes of men have different interests.
The big merchants, with their bold speculations, are
impatient of anything which hinders circulation:
town dues, customs, tolls, differences of coinage, weights
and measures, all regulations, everything, in fact, which
tends to isolate towns and countries. When Louis XI.
convoked the States General in 1484, the town deputies
expressed themselves in favour of the freedom of trade,
which now felt strong enough to stand alone. When
Henry IV., on the advice of Montchrestian and Laffemas,
wanted to secure French markets to the French by
increasing customs tariffs, all the guilds consulted
declared themselves in favour of the project, with the
exception of the mercers&mdash;&ldquo;sellers of everything,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>
makers of nothing,&rdquo; as they were called&mdash;thus plainly
expressing the hostility of wholesale trade to the exclusive
policy which had been pursued by the towns.
The great traders represented a revolutionary tendency
with regard to the guild system; they were its constant
enemies; they ended by being its destroyers.</p>

<p>The manufacturers, for their part, were not averse
to being protected against foreign competition; they
were indeed inclined to ask for this protection. Like
the guilds, they had a predilection for privilege and
monopoly, but were not in agreement with them
on some essential points. In order to produce much
and profitably they were in need of cheap and abundant
labour. Ignoring the rules of apprenticeship, they hired
foreigners, peasants, women, and children; in the
sixteenth century, in the town of Norwich, which from
being agricultural had become industrial, children of
six were employed in the factories.<a name="FNanchor_96" id="FNanchor_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> When they did
not crowd the workers together in enormous workshops,
they resorted to what sometimes goes by the equivocal
name of &ldquo;the domestic system,&rdquo; which I prefer to call
&ldquo;scattered manufacture.&rdquo; In the towns they employed
men and women, who, working in their own
homes, were sheltered from inquisitive eyes. Such
workers were found in the suburban and country
districts, in any places which were beyond the ordinary
jurisdiction of wardenship and mastership. Or again,
they employed labour in the hospitals, orphanages, or
work-rooms of religious orders, which had escaped from
the jealous supervision of the guilds. In Picardy, at
certain periods, the weaver workmen thus scattered
among the villages numbered 10,000.<a name="FNanchor_97" id="FNanchor_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> The same thing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>
was to be found in Brittany,<a name="FNanchor_98" id="FNanchor_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> Normandy, and Dauphiny,
in the manufacture of linen and hemp; in Velay in
that of lace; in Auvergne in that of trimmings; in
the Rhone valley in that of silk. In England the
peasants, driven from home, impoverished, eaten out
by sheep, deprived of their means of livelihood by the
enclosure of huge pasture lands to which they might
no longer take their cattle, provided a wonderful reserve
army for industrial magnates in search of labour.<a name="FNanchor_99" id="FNanchor_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a>
The town artisans fought with desperation against
the blows struck at town monopolies by these new
departures.<a name="FNanchor_100" id="FNanchor_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> Opposition&mdash;significant but utterly useless&mdash;was
offered on every hand to the new demands of
large-scale production. Risings against foreign workers,
like those at Norwich; the many attempts to limit
the number of apprentices; the English law of 1555
known as the Weavers&rsquo; Act, which forbade a master to
own or hire out more than a certain number of looms;
and the innumerable lawsuits in France brought by
guilds to check the disastrous competition of peasant
labour were all illustrations of this opposition.</p>

<p>Another necessity of large-scale production, involving
still greater consequences, was mechanical labour.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great&rdquo; industry demanded the division&mdash;even
the disintegration&mdash;of labour. The product, before it
is finished, passes through the hands of various craft
groups. It undergoes a series of processes which
follow one another and are interdependent, and of
which each is carried out by specially trained workers.
This was the case in the manufacture of wool from the
thirteenth century. The wool had to be washed, beaten,
carded, combed, oiled, spun, woven, fulled; then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>
cloth had to be stretched, dyed, dressed, and folded.
It is a well-known fact that if each class of work is
entrusted to a special class of workers, manufacture
costs less both in money and in time. But it must be
added that this disintegration of the whole process
into a succession of operations leads straight to the
mechanical system.<a name="FNanchor_101" id="FNanchor_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> The simple and monotonous
tasks performed under this system of subdivision by
the different classes of workers owe their automatic
and half-mechanical character to the uniformity of the
movements they demand. It needed very little to
complete the technical revolution already begun and
to make hands of wood or metal accomplish what had
been done by human hands.</p>

<p>A machine may be described as a more or less complicate
engine, which, by means of an animate or
inanimate motive force, executes movements which
hitherto have been performed by the human hand. The
weaving loom and the spinning wheel were already rudimentary
machines. The Middle Ages knew, under the
name of &ldquo;mills,&rdquo; more complicate appliances, of which
many date from the Alexandrine period, which was to
Graeco-Roman antiquity what the nineteenth century
is to modern times&mdash;the era of science and machinery.</p>

<p>Water- or wind-mills, mills for grinding flour, for
crushing nuts or olives, for raising water; iron mills;
mills for fulling cloth, for making paper, sugar, silk
stuffs&mdash;all these expensive appliances were in use, and
gradually spread over Europe during the period which
brought to a close and immediately followed the Middle
Ages. Thus old industries changed their method, and
new industries were from the start modelled on the new
system.</p>

<p>Printing may be quoted as an example; the printing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
press, with its movable letters, took the place of writing&mdash;the
work of human fingers. It may be said of it
that it was born mechanical, and if we ask why it
killed the slow industry of the old copyists who
protested in vain, we need only look at the unexpected
results it achieved. The identity of the copies
produced; the speed, which allowed demands hitherto
forced to wait months and years to be met in a few
days, and which gave, so to speak, wings to thought;
and the unheard-of cheapness, which reduced the
price of a Bible from 600 to 60 crowns and even less
(things which evidently could not be obtained without
the co-operation of the Prince of Darkness, as was
proved by the red characters which flamed at the head
of the chapters), such were the diabolical but invaluable
advantages which in less than half a century
assured the triumph and the rapid spread of the new
invention.</p>

<p>If we remember the thousand-and-one prohibitions
with which the guild statutes bristled&mdash;the prohibition
to mould seals with engraved letters, the regulations
which in every craft prevented all change and consequently
all improvement in manufacture, it is easy to
understand how &ldquo;great&rdquo; industry, without deliberate
effort, but by its very development, overthrew the
economic order which had reigned in the Middle Ages.
The guilds, moreover, with the best intentions in the
world, fought against innovations which seemed to them
abominations. In England in the year 1555 the <i>gig-mill</i>,
a mechanical appliance, was forbidden by law.<a name="FNanchor_102" id="FNanchor_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a>
The first English coaches, called &ldquo;flying coaches,&rdquo;
were attacked and censured<a name="FNanchor_103" id="FNanchor_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> because they threatened
to injure the art of riding and the manufacture of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
saddles and spurs, and because, being too cold in winter
and too hot in summer, they were bad for the health of
travellers; but, above all, because, on account of their
extreme speed, they would be dangerous. The public
authorities were begged to limit them to thirty miles a
day (rather less than the distance a fast train covers
to-day in an hour); and later, in France, when the
<i>turgotines</i> were instituted, which shortened by half the
length of a journey, an abbot added the strange complaint
that, by going so fast, they deprived the passenger
of the means of hearing mass.<a name="FNanchor_104" id="FNanchor_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;Great&rdquo; commerce and &ldquo;great&rdquo; industry, however,
continued to develop in the direction they had originally
taken, and finally overcame the old-fashioned timidity
of the guilds, which were gradually reduced to defending
the interests of the small crafts. The great merchant
guilds were predominant at first; the Lord Mayor of
London was chosen from the city guilds, and the guild
of the river merchants gave to Paris its coat-of-arms
and motto and was an embryonic form of the municipal
councils which followed later. As time went on, however,
they disappeared or separated themselves from
the organized crafts. At Paris, the Hanse of the river
merchants does not figure among the <i>six guilds</i> which
head the list, although they did not actually lose their
privileges till the year 1672. In London,<a name="FNanchor_105" id="FNanchor_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> the city
guilds slowly ceased to have any connection with the
crafts whose names they bore. The great capitalists,
whether bankers, merchants, or great manufacturers,
voluntarily formed themselves into a separate group
and, as far as possible, cut themselves clear of the
trammels of the guild system.</p>

<p>Meantime, under the system of large-scale produc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>tion,
the workers were either subjected to the guilds
as we have seen them at Florence in the <i>Arte della
Lana</i>,<a name="FNanchor_106" id="FNanchor_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> or else, if they were not enrolled, were treated by
their individual masters in such a way as to keep them
permanently in a precarious and subordinate position.
Whether they worked crowded together in great workshops&mdash;where,
owing to their numbers, they were under
severe discipline&mdash;or at home, in which case their
isolation only brought them, under the appearance of
liberty, harder conditions, they soon saw that, with
the rarest possible exceptions, they were destined to be
wage-earners for life. They no longer had the hope,
the ambition, even the idea of one day owning the
factory in which they laboured, or the business which
every week paid its thousands of workers. The divorce
was complete between the manual worker and the
instruments of production, and, in consequence, between
the men who were the servants of these expensive
appliances and the master-manufacturers who owned
them. Masters and workmen, henceforth separated
by their present and their future, by their education,
their manner of life, and their aspirations, formed two
classes, united as yet, in that both were interested in the
intensity of industrial activity, but opposed, in that
the one wished to keep the other in subjection and to
sweat out of him as much work as possible, as cheaply
as possible.</p>

<p>It is from this time, and still only in &ldquo;great&rdquo;
industry, that a working class can be spoken of. For a
long time it was fairly small; but the self-consciousness
it was acquiring was shown by the strikes, the combinations,
and the attempts at union which were common
in England from the sixteenth century; by combinations
which were already national, like that of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>

<p>From now onwards can be found all those motives
for disagreement with which the &ldquo;social question,&rdquo; as
it has developed and grown more bitter, has made us
familiar;&mdash;increase of hours of work, lowering of wages
by the employment of apprentices, women, and children;
reductions of the sums agreed upon by means of fines,
payment in kind,<a name="FNanchor_110" id="FNanchor_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> and other tricks; draconian regulations;
harsh foremen; the binding of the workers to
the workshop, as the serfs were to the soil, by money
advances which they could never repay. Events follow
their usual course: the story is one of struggles, prosecutions,
appeals to the law, and finally, when no
more can be said, battles with folded arms and closed
factories&mdash;strikes by workmen or employers. There
follow riots in which machinery is wrecked and
attacks are sometimes made upon the masters themselves.
Repression ensues; the carrying of arms is
forbidden, the rights of combination and public
meeting denied at pain of death. And, in reply to
these measures, the workers retaliate by emigration,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span>
by secret societies, by recourse to force which may
damp down the fire but cannot prevent it from
smouldering till in time it bursts out afresh.</p>

<p>The guilds and their statutes were of but feeble
assistance in calming these conflicts. The greater part
of the workers in the great industries did not belong to
them. Worse still, the guild system itself suffered
from the startling inequality which separated its great
manufacturers from their employees. Between rich
masters and small masters, between the sons of masters
and the poor journeymen, the gulf ever widened, and an
institution was soon to reveal the growing friction.
I have already spoken of the separate societies, now of
long standing, governed by journeymen (<i>compagnons</i>);
but <i>compagnonnage</i>, united to these ancient associations
by more than one tie, had a more extensive
influence. Its origins are obscure.<a name="FNanchor_111" id="FNanchor_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> It is hardly
found before the beginning of the fifteenth century,
and developed particularly in Central Europe, France,
the Low Countries, and in Germany. It seems to be
allied to freemasonry in its origins, but was distinguished
by an activity peculiar to itself. Freemasonry,
as far as it is possible to pierce the mists which envelop
its early history, was essentially a federation of building
trades. It took its birth from the bands of workmen who
had their <i>raison d&rsquo;être</i> in the construction of those vast
cathedrals whose harmonious proportions are certainly
the most perfect legacy left to us by the Middle Ages.
The aim of the association was to keep in order the
crowds of half-nomadic labourers, who for half a century
or more would establish themselves in a town;
to transmit from one generation to the next the secrets<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>
of the craft; to act as arbitrator in the quarrels which
might arise among this restless population. Born in
the shadow of the sanctuary, it was naturally mystic
and religious in character; it claimed to go back to the
Templars, or even to the builders of Solomon&rsquo;s Temple;
it was the child of an age which delighted in mystery
and occult knowledge, and it imposed on its members
a complicated initiation, formidable tests, signs of recognition,
and pass-words. Created for men who sometimes
transferred their labour and their plans from one
end of Europe to the other, it scattered its lodges
over different lands; it was international, and in this
differed profoundly from the guilds. But with this
exception, it took its place within the existing order of
things, accepted the hierarchy of the guild system, and
had its three degrees&mdash;<i>i.e.</i> included apprentices, journeymen,
and masters. It was a mixed institution as much
and even more bourgeois than working-class.</p>

<p><i>Compagnonnage</i>, too, covered many craft-guilds, of
which the most important were closely connected with
building (carpenters, stone-cutters, joiners) or with the
clothing trades. It had its mystic legends, its symbolic
rites in which baptism and communion figured, its
claims to a long genealogy, its tests, pass-words, and
strange ceremonies, in fact the whole armoury of a
society which believes secrecy to be of vital importance.
It was a league for mutual and fraternal assistance,
which spread over many countries and undertook to
procure for its travelling members moral support,
lodging, travel-money, and, above all, work. But it
differed from the guilds and from freemasonry in that
no masters were admitted. It concerned itself exclusively
with obtaining work for <i>compagnons</i>, and
with looking after their professional interests. It thus
emphasized the separation which had taken place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>
between masters and workers. It was feared as an
instrument of war, suspected on account of its secret
methods by the public authorities which persecuted
it, and by the Church which accused it of disseminating
heretical ideas and condemned it in 1655 by the voice
of the Faculty of Theology at Paris; it was also exposed
to the attacks of the guilds. Nevertheless it
survived all this, and was strong enough to organize
strikes, and to black-list the firms which did not accept
its conditions, and even the towns in which it was
persecuted.<a name="FNanchor_112" id="FNanchor_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p>Of course its strength and power of emancipation
must not be exaggerated. <i>Compagnonnage</i> remained
bound by the customs and liable to the vices of the
guild system. If it escaped from the restraining spirit
it did not escape from the corporate spirit; it jealously
closed its ranks, and would only admit certain crafts;
it was divided into hostile rites or <i>devoirs</i> which took
for patrons Solomon, Maître Jacques, or Père Soubise.
Violence was frequent (<i>topage</i> for instance), and bloody
battles for the monopoly of work in a particular town
often took place. Besides, it only included a privileged
minority who ill-treated and despised not only
those who were outside their ranks but even those who
aspired to enter them. It was on the whole a fighting
league, and imposed conditions on certain masters; but
it was far from being a combination of the whole of the
working classes against the masters.</p>

<p>Centuries were yet to pass before the development
of &ldquo;great&rdquo; industry, by constantly increasing the
number employed, by turning the suburbs of great
cities and the black country into seething human anthills,
forced all these multitudes of workers, in spite of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
wide differences of occupation, to unite into a great
army.</p>

<p>As has been said, the division of society into guilds
is vertical; it only becomes horizontal when the conditions
common to the great army of wage-earners
blot out all differences of craft and origin.</p>

<p>2. <i>The change in intellectual conditions. The Renaissance
and the Reformation.</i>&mdash;We have summed up
the effects produced on the guilds by the enlargement
of the environment in which they developed. This
environment, however, changed not only in extent but
also in character. Without going into the details
of the changes they passed through, we can see that
three great events stand out in the history of Europe
from the fifteenth to the end of the seventeenth century,
and it is impossible that they should have failed
to react on the system we are studying; these are the
Renaissance, the Reformation, and the increase in the
powers of the State.</p>

<p>The great intellectual revolution which has been
named the Renaissance was at first a return to Greek
and Roman antiquity. Literary men and scholars,
filled with adoration for a glorious past, abandoned
their mother tongue for that of the great dead, imitated
Virgil, Cicero, Demosthenes, swore by Jupiter and
Mercury, insisted, like Montaigne, on being given the
title of Roman citizens, or like Erasmus, Ramus, or
Melanchthon, took neo-classical names. They restored
ancient methods of thought and action; they wove
conspiracies in imitation of Brutus; they dated their
letters by the Calends and the Ides; they became
pagans once more in appearance and sometimes in
reality; in opposition to Christianity&mdash;the religion of
sadness, resignation, poverty, and of the struggle
against the flesh and passion&mdash;they re-established love,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>
pleasure, beauty, and the joy of life. They wakened
from their long slumber the old systems of philosophy,
and as disciples not only of Aristotle, but of Plato,
Epicurus, and Diogenes, they became accustomed to
coquetting with every kind of doctrine and often
acquired an elegant dilettantism.</p>

<p>These new conceptions, which demanded a knowledge
of languages requiring long study at college,
could only be held by an <i>élite</i>. To have the right of
initiation into the ancient authors it was necessary
to belong to the leisured classes; it took time to
read and re-read them in order to extract the &ldquo;marrow
within.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In a word, the Renaissance was fundamentally
aristocratic. Most of its classical scholars and poets
profess disdain and hatred of the ignorant masses.</p>

<div class="center"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Rien ne me plaist que ce qui peut desplaire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Au jugement du rude populaire<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>cries one of the brilliant satellites of our Pléiade.<a name="FNanchor_113" id="FNanchor_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a></p>

<p>It follows logically that the education it instituted
and which was founded on the study of Greek and
Latin drew a clear line of demarcation between the
children thus brought up, who were destined to hold
the highest social positions, and the others doomed to
inferior tasks and studies. It will therefore be understood
that the Renaissance influenced the condition
of the workers. It swelled the tide which was
carrying society towards class division; it helped to
separate still further the tradesman and the manual
worker; and above all it separated the artist and the
craftsman, those twin brothers, who till then had shared
the same life and the same ideals. The artist was no
longer the interpreter of the thought of a whole people,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span>
but, working for the rich and powerful bankers or
princes, who required him to reproduce archaic forms
and consequently demanded of him a certain amount
of education, he left the ranks of the people, rose to
wealth, to the ranks of the upper middle classes, and
figured at court; he and his fellows grouped themselves
into special brotherhoods such as that of St. Luke at
Rome, and before long formed academies inaccessible
to the vulgar. Compare the life of Raphael with that
of Giotto. In these days, the craftsman remained a
working man, lost in the crowd, watching from afar
and from his lowly station his successful comrade, who
no longer recognized the poor relation he had left
behind.</p>

<p>Separations of this kind abound in almost every
direction. In the Middle Ages grocers and apothecaries,
barbers and surgeons, were classed together. But in the
sixteenth century the apothecary, on his admission to
mastership, had to reply in Latin, and henceforth he no
longer considered the spice merchant his equal. So
in France, from the year 1514, the bond between the
two professions was broken.</p>

<p>The historian can easily prove that this separation
of art and craft was often harmful to both; that art,
isolated from the warm heart of the people, became
conventional, cold, stiff, and artificial; that craft,
relegated to a lower position, no longer sought for
beauty, and was condemned to express itself in inferior,
routine work; but, taking the guilds alone, this
separation certainly weakened the mediaeval system.
Deprived of members whose gifts were their glory,
they lost in power as in prestige.</p>

<p>In spite of all this, and although the Renaissance is
from some points of view a retrogression towards social
conditions which had long disappeared, it was more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>
than this; it was the awakening of the spirit of
initiative; it was a forward impulse, a bold step in
advance. It was not limited to a mere renewal of
relations with classical antiquity; it stimulated inventive
effort, and taught men to think for themselves once
more, to open their eyes and to observe. It thus gave
a strong impetus to science. The age is rich in many-sided
geniuses and seekers after truth, who widened
the field of human knowledge and power in every
direction. It saw the birth of those universalists,
Leonardo da Vinci and Michael Angelo, who may be
likened to trees, which, by the mysterious process of
grafting, bear twenty different kinds of fruit. In short,
the Renaissance was a setting free of intelligence, a breaking
forth of truths, which, thanks to printing, spread
all over the world and became a lasting possession.</p>

<p>It is true, indeed, that mankind, like the Wandering
Jew, is always moving forward, and never comes completely
to a standstill. Man moves ceaselessly because
he is alive. But after the great creative movement
which is the glory of modern times, his progress is more
apparent, surer, and more rapid. From this time must
be dated a permanent alliance between science and
industry, exemplified in that heroic potter, Bernard
Palissy, who spent his life and fortune in rediscovering
the secret of certain enamelled pottery. The pity is
that this alliance, so fruitful in new methods, in the
exploitation of new materials and new products, was
formed at the expense of the guilds; for the innovations
which it rendered necessary were the death of
their rules governing manufacture. Everything contributed,
as we can see, to the break-up of the organization
of labour which they embodied.</p>

<p>The same may be said of the Reformation, the
religious renaissance, which was both a development of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
and a reaction from its fellow. It could hardly be expected
that a revolution which rent Western Christianity
asunder should spare the unity of the craft guilds.
True, it did not act in the same way: by making
the reading of the Bible obligatory it encouraged the
education of the people, and in this way it raised
the craftsman. It found, and not without reason,
its first adherents among workmen,&mdash;Saxon miners,
carders from the town of Meaux; it turned towards
democracy, towards theories of equality. Those who
carried it to extremes, like the Anabaptists of Münster,
pictured a government in which all the guilds, great and
small, should be made equal; their ideal was to turn
all organized crafts, superior and inferior, into a sort
of public service; to establish a kind of Biblical
communism. Their leader and prophet was John of
Leyden, an aged working tailor.<a name="FNanchor_114" id="FNanchor_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> If this was only a
passing birth-throe of Protestantism at least the guilds
took a large share in the great movements which shook
Holland and England. It really seems that the Reformation
brought a renewal of vigour and activity
to those states in which it triumphed. But in many
countries the fight between the two faiths was so fierce
that many cities were devastated and ruined by it.
In Germany, after the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, Magdeburg,
Wurtzburg, Heidelberg, Spire, and Mannheim were
simply heaps of ruins, almost deserted. The Teutonic
Hanse which had been so powerful was a wreck; the
Protestant and Catholic towns had broken the union
in which their strength lay. In a hundred places, since
it was admitted that the religion of the prince was law
for his subjects (<i>cujus regio, hujus religio</i>) whole bodies
of people and industries moved away; workmen and
masters went in search of refuge among their co-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span>religionists.
The guild system was profoundly disturbed
by this; the new-comers, when they were too
numerous, were not always very warmly welcomed by
their brothers in God, and even when they were received,
they practically forced their way into a closed
system which they strained to breaking.</p>

<p>In places where the population remained divided
between the two creeds, or where, more from indifference
to, than respect for, the beliefs of others, they made a
lame attempt at tolerance, it was extremely difficult to
get men of the two sects to live together in the same
body. Just as the Jews had been excluded from the
guilds in the Middle Ages, so now the Protestants were
kept out. In France, from the time of Richelieu, fifty
years before the repeal of the Edict of Nantes, the professions
of a doctor, apothecary, grocer, and many others
were forbidden to them.<a name="FNanchor_115" id="FNanchor_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Then came the great exodus
of 1685, which scattered the French Huguenots over
every place in Europe where they had friends, and
planted colonies of refugees in Switzerland, England,
Holland, Prussia, Denmark, and Sweden. &ldquo;They
carried commerce away with them,&rdquo; says Jurieu, one
of their pastors; and <i>commerce</i> in the language of those
days included what we call industry. The fact is that
they naturalized abroad many manufactures which had
hitherto been unknown. England alone learnt from
them the arts of silk-making, Gobelins tapestry-making,
and sail-making. What then became of the guilds which
remained in France, of the monopoly at which they
aimed, and of the secrecy which was one of their methods
of securing it? It was a terrible blow for them when,
as at Abbeville, 80 families out of 160 left the country,
or 1600 out of 2200, as happened at the election of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
Amiens.<a name="FNanchor_116" id="FNanchor_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> How, thus mutilated, could they stand
against the foreign competition of which their own
members had become the most formidable allies?</p>

<p>3. <i>The change in political conditions.</i>&mdash;Changes in
political conditions affected the guilds even more
than intellectual and religious changes. Europe, in
spite of waves of revolt, passed through a period in
which great powers prevailed. The State, which was
becoming centralized, increased its prerogatives and
complacently interfered in economic matters. The
motives which determined its intervention were sometimes
a purely <i>political</i> interest, sometimes a <i>fiscal</i>
interest, sometimes a <i>public</i> or <i>national</i> interest.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The political interest of Sovereigns is to subdue
rival powers within their territories. For this reason
they first attacked the liberties of any cities where the
spirit was bad, that is to say, as a King of Prussia said
later, <i>frondeur</i>, intractable, or restless. In Spain their
<i>fueros</i> were taken from them; in France, town liberties
decreased, till they were almost entirely destroyed by
Richelieu and Louis XIV. In Germany, the number
of free Hanseatic cities dropped from eighty to three.
The Italian republics fell one by one under the domination
of a monarch, and, though Venice survived, she had
concentrated her government in the hands of three
State judges, magistrates as autocratic and irresponsible
as kings. In the Low Countries, Bruges lost all jurisdiction
over her suburbs in 1435, and Ghent lost the
power in 1451, and also the right to nominate the
aldermen. Liége, like her neighbour Dinant, was
destroyed, crushed, reduced to nothing. In the following
century Antwerp, suspected of sympathy with the
Reformation, lived under the Spanish yoke, pillaged
and down-trodden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>Municipal and guild life were so closely united that
it was impossible to strike at one without injuring the
other. In the city of Liége, the thirty-two crafts and
the <i>perron</i> which was the emblem of its independence
were taken away at a single stroke.</p>

<p>At Florence, no sooner had the Medicis become
Dukes of Tuscany than the Constitution of the <i>Arte</i>
was altered in such a way as to make it impossible for
them to exercise any influence in the direction of public
affairs. In England,<a name="FNanchor_117" id="FNanchor_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> the king and Parliament agreed
in forbidding the guilds to make ordinances without
the consent of the Chancellor of the Exchequer and
the Crown Treasurer, or to fix the price of goods, and
aimed at supplanting them in supervising the quality
of products. The Statute of Labourers in 1563, in the
reign of Elizabeth, gave to justices of the peace, that
is to say, to magistrates who were not craftsmen, the
right of fixing workmen&rsquo;s wages. In France, Philip
the Beautiful ill-treated the confraternities and found
no difficulty in modifying the rules of the Parisian
industries.<a name="FNanchor_118" id="FNanchor_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> The Crown, however, differentiated between
the guilds: at the beginning of the fifteenth
century, the doctor of theology, John Gerson, lays down
in the clearest terms the alliance between the Crown
and the rich burgesses: &ldquo;All the harm,&rdquo; he says,
&ldquo;arises from the fact that the king and the good
burgesses have been put under servitude by the outrageous
enterprise of men of small standing.... God has
permitted it in order that we may know the difference
between royal domination and that of any people
whatever: for that which is royal is general and
should be gentle: that of the low-born is a tyrannical
domination which destroys itself.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_119" id="FNanchor_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> In accordance with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>
this principle, royalty was tactful in its dealings with
the great guilds, and willingly bestowed on them
honorary privileges. Francis I. not only confirmed to
the Six Guilds, which formed the merchant aristocracy
of the capital, the precedence which they enjoyed
at solemn functions, but of the thirty-six wardens of
these Greater Guilds as they would have been called
at Florence, he formed a High Council of Parisian
industry.</p>

<p>Even with the others, the Crown proceeded gently
at first. It desired to absorb, and not to suppress. It
realized what an advantage it would be if these independent
institutions, still under the influence of their
feudal origin, could be transformed into State institutions,
protected and obedient! It was with this end
in view that Henry III. decided that their organization,
hitherto local, should be extended throughout the
whole kingdom, to the scattered villages as well as to
the towns. The city (urban) guild was therefore converted
into a national organism, and the guild was
made compulsory at the same time that it was put under
tutelage. This unification, which placed it under the
direct supervision of royal agents, was, however, only
to operate on paper. It encountered the displeasure of
the craft guilds; worse still, it was in opposition to the
first principle of the whole system. The ordinance
allowed the inhabitants of the suburbs to follow their
craft within the cities, and the inhabitants of one town
to settle in any other, with the exception of Paris<a name="FNanchor_120" id="FNanchor_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a>&mdash;a
last concession to an ancient tradition. It was something
quite new for craftsmen to possess equal rights
and for crafts to be organized like those of Paris throughout
the whole of France; but it was only in accordance
with the general trend of French civilization. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
sudden enlargement of the guild system, however, was
practically its death, and there were many who from
this time did not hesitate to say so openly.<a name="FNanchor_121" id="FNanchor_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> The
edict, renewed by Henry IV. in 1597, was next extended
to include merchants, and was completed by
the abolition of the <i>king of the mercers</i>, who still
exercised a certain amount of authority in the fairs;
for even so trumpery a king made the king at the
Louvre uneasy!</p>

<p>The Crown was the less willing to give up its ideas of
realizing unity in the industrial domain in that it mistrusted
the small crafts; it bore in mind the fact that,
formerly, when the Holy League tried to create a sort
of intermunicipal federal Republic, the masters&rsquo; and
journeymen&rsquo;s confraternities eagerly joined in the
attempt. It did not forget that, in the time of the
Fronde, the guilds were credited with having had the
repeal of the privileges granted to the great merchants
and the prohibition to import silks into the kingdom inserted
in the peace treaty forced on the Regent by his
rebel subjects. Little by little it reduced the authority
remaining to them. It was tenacious in carrying into
every sphere the form of organization at which it
aimed. It made further attempts in 1673 and 1691;
between the first date and the second the guilds officially
constituted and classified rose from 60 to 127, and
what clearly shows the meaning of this administrative
classification is the fact that it nominated, or threatened
the nomination of, the headmen by officers of the
Crown.</p>

<p>A very inadequate idea, however, of the encroachments
of royal authority will be gained if the solemn
publication of edicts alone is remembered, and the daily,
incessant attempt of its agents to restrict the jurisdic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>tion
both of local and of guild authorities is ignored.
No doubt a good deal of the economic jurisdiction
formerly exercised by the town magistrates still existed.
Contraventions of regulations, and struggles between
producers and consumers, between employers and
employees, and between allied and rival crafts, were
under municipal jurisdiction.<a name="FNanchor_122" id="FNanchor_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The right of pronouncing
judgment on such points as falsifications, the observance
of religious festivals, the price of merchandise and the
rate of wages, was still left to the municipality by Colbert.
Naturally its powers were greater or less according
as the town was royal, seigneurial, or communal.
But it was not unusual for it to retain the right of
collecting taxes, and of nominating supervisors who controlled
crafts; for it to create masterships and organize
charity workshops which changed into regular factories;
or to withhold the monopoly granted to the guilds.</p>

<p>It is none the less true that communal jurisdiction
grew less year by year. Attention must be drawn to
the fact that the craft guilds sometimes passed it by
and of their own accord applied to the central authority
for intervention. Thus, questions of provisions, public
health, monopoly, speculation, regulations for the prevention
of fraud, and the protection of apprentices,
one by one came under the jurisdiction of <i>parlements</i>,
ministers, governors, and of their delegates. Colbert,
in his general rules for manufacture which date from
1666 to 1669, codifies, in the name of the State, the
minute directions contained in the guild statutes on
questions of apportionment, bad work, etc.</p>

<p>At the end of the seventeenth century, then, the guilds
still existed, but had been subjugated and deprived of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span>
their principal rights. Behind the solid front which
they still presented were ruin, desolation, and decay.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) It is probable that the Crown in France allowed
them to live and decline in peace because they supplied
an easy method of directing commerce and industry;
but it was also because they were fruitful sources
of production. The Crown often disguised with fine
phrases the <i>fiscal interest</i> which inspired it; it is,
however, easily discoverable in three different forms.
Sometimes it confirmed, strengthened, and extended
the monopoly of the guilds and made them pay for the
favour; sometimes it sold to outsiders privileges which
encroached on and compromised this monopoly; and
finally, it sometimes threatened them, and only withdrew
threats in return for ready money.</p>

<p>The great ordinance of 1581 and the special edict of
taxes of 1673 may be taken as examples of the first
method. In 1581 the strengthening of the organization
of the guilds by purging them of certain abuses
and irregularities was the pretext cited; the king
spoke and appeared to act as the great national justice
of the peace; but the real object of the measure, which
extended to the kingdom a system hitherto localized, may
well have been the filling of the royal treasury into which
fell a part of the matriculation fees paid by each new
master. In 1673 trouble was no longer taken to find a
pretext; the work was done by a financial edict, that
is, by the establishment of a method of taxation. The
guilds themselves encouraged these calls on their funds;
indeed, in 1636, when France was in danger of invasion,
they offered their wealth and their services for the
defence of the kingdom.</p>

<p>The second means, which consisted in creating privileges
for which the guilds paid and by which the king&rsquo;s
coffers were filled, was invented by Louis XI., who in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>
1461 instituted <i>letters of mastership</i>, which exempted
those who bought them from the examination of
capability and the expenses which the ordinary reception
entailed. Soon the kings introduced irregularities
into the masters&rsquo; guilds on every possible occasion.<a name="FNanchor_123" id="FNanchor_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a>
The blow could not miss its aim. If none were found
to take these licences, the guilds hastened to buy
them up to prevent the intrusion of new competitors.
In vain they attempted to protest; the procedure
became habitual and legal. The great ordinance of
1581 stated that the king would dispose of three letters
of mastership in every town and every craft.</p>

<p>This led to a third procedure. The guild was vulnerable
at many points, in its revenues and in its autonomy,
as well as in its monopolies. If a pretence was made
of attacking its weak spots, it would pay in order to
be spared. It clung to the right of electing its own
officers. Now Francis I. had already introduced among
them royal officers who had naturally bought their
office. At the end of the seventeenth century the
Crown, being short of money, renewed this expedient
on a large scale. In 1691 it declared its intention of
replacing all the officers and syndics by agents of its
own nomination, and the guilds had immediately to
raise three hundred thousand pounds to avert the
calamity which threatened them. It was thus that the
Jews and Lombards had formerly liberated themselves.
In 1694 the king took it into his head to institute
auditors and examiners to control their accounts;
another sacrifice of four hundred thousand pounds was
demanded before these were removed. In this way
from year to year posts were created and bought up.
In 1711 the pressure brought to bear was even stronger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
and more direct; the admission of new masters was
forbidden, and they were created by royal authority
without the assent of the guilds. The guilds gave
everything that was demanded of them, everything at
least that was in their power; they borrowed, got into
debt, became involved and were on the verge of bankruptcy;
just as the communes had formerly succumbed
under the weight of the too heavy burdens imposed on
them by the Crown.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The Crown was not always actuated by such
personally interested motives; it sometimes happened
that it was moved by nobler inspirations in its relations
with the craft guilds, and studied the general interest
when it restricted their exorbitant privileges.</p>

<p>In order to develop public assistance with little
expense, those who participated in works of charity
were recompensed by being exonerated from corporate
obligations. In 1553 an edict conferred mastership
on all craftsmen who consented to teach their craft to
the children of the Hospital of the Trinity, and the
hospital itself thus became a factory working against
the guilds. Several hospitals were in a similar position.
In the seventeenth century, however, it was with a
different aim,&mdash;the development of national industry,&mdash;that
the Crown deliberately created factories not
under guild rule. Henry IV., in order to naturalize
in France the silk industry, which diverted from
the kingdom seven to eight thousand gold crowns
annually, planted mulberry trees, and brought in
Italian workmen on whom he lavished money and
monopolies, and who were exempted from taxation,
in order that they might teach the art of weaving
these valuable stuffs. In 1607 he installed, in the
great gallery at the Louvre, a colony of foreign craftsmen&mdash;a
sort of industrial school of art where apprentices<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
were trained&mdash;who might establish themselves anywhere
in the kingdom without waiting to become masters.
He thus launched the industry of luxury and attempted
to organize, over the heads of the guilds, that which
was most distasteful to them,&mdash;innovation, while their
domain was still further restricted by the special conditions
granted to merchants who followed the Court
and became tradesmen by appointment to princes and
to the most brilliant of the nobility.</p>

<p>Colbert built up into a system what Henry IV. had
practised, and great factories rose at his command.
These were of two kinds: first, <i>royal factories</i> properly
so called&mdash;State establishments, in which all expenses
were borne by the Treasury; the director was nominated
by the king, and the privilege which they enjoyed
was in perpetuity (the soap works of Beauvais, Aubusson,
the naval workshops in the ports, etc.). Others,
also called &ldquo;royal factories,&rdquo; were, in spite of this
ambiguous name, private enterprises; they enjoyed
important privileges, such as exemption from taxes,
subsidies, or titles of nobility for those who directed
them; but they were only temporary, and the company,
with a private individual at its head, was worked at its
own risk and peril. I will only quote one example,
the cloth factory of the Van Robais at Abbeville.
No matter what their methods of administration,
for the guilds they were so many formidable competitors,
and it is easy to imagine the futile complaints
and remonstrances of which they were the
object.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) We have described in detail the policy of the
French Crown with regard to the craft guilds, partly
because this book is written in France and for the French,
but also because it developed with remarkable logic
and continuity. In neighbouring countries, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
what happened was, if not exactly the same, at least
similar.</p>

<p>In England, when we study the encroachments of
the central authority, we find that, in spite of the
Commons, who represented the commercial class, the
kings authorized foreign merchants to reside in the
ports where originally they had to sell their cargoes
wholesale within forty days, and that in 1335 they
were allowed to trade freely throughout the kingdom.<a name="FNanchor_124" id="FNanchor_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a>
We find three Parliaments in turn making
laws to impose certain industrial methods on the whole
country, and many acts of legislation are to be found
regulating &ldquo;the size and weight of pieces of stuff,
the methods of stretching and dyeing, the preparation
of wool by means of certain ingredients the use of
which was allowed or forbidden, the finishing of cloth,
folding and packing, etc.&rdquo;<a name="FNanchor_125" id="FNanchor_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> A whole army of officials
was needed to see that these complicated laws,&mdash;which
from being guild laws became national laws,&mdash;were not
broken. In 1563 the Statute of Labourers codified in
this way, in the name of the State, rules for apprenticeship
and for other matters which had hitherto been in
force among the craft guilds.</p>

<p>At Florence, from the year 1580, under the rule of
the Medicis, who had become sovereign princes, the
statutes of the Guild of Silk or Por Santa Maria,&mdash;hitherto
the most important Guild,&mdash;were reconstituted,
and governors, whose jurisdiction extended over the
whole of Tuscany, were set up beside the consuls. These
were still elected by the masters, but if one of the chosen
magistrates were not approved (<i>la grazia</i>) by His Serene
Highness, that was enough to disqualify him. From this
time no subject could be brought up for debate in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>
assemblies of the <i>Arte</i> unless it had first been submitted
to the said Serene Highness, who could either allow it
to be introduced or could stop its passage.<a name="FNanchor_126" id="FNanchor_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> In 1583
His Highness took upon himself to unite two ancient
guilds (Fabbricanti and Por San Piero); he had the seal
of the new guild remade, and the statutes, which even
fixed the salaries of the officers, reconstituted.</p>

<p>By degrees the consuls ceased to be chosen from
<i>Arti</i> over which they nominally presided; they became
personages who assumed honorary titles, and the actual
power was in the hands of &ldquo;deputies&rdquo; (to-day we
should call them delegates) nominated by the prince;<a name="FNanchor_127" id="FNanchor_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a>
the organization of crafts became purely bureaucratic
and the ancient <i>Calimala</i> a mere charitable body.
Wherever tribunals and chambers of commerce or
technical schools were formed, wherever foreign craftsmen
were called in and welcomed, there it may be
said that the doom of the guilds was sealed.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VII" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII</a><br />
<span class="smaller">INTERNAL CAUSES OF DECAY</span></h2>

<p>The guilds could only have been successful in their
resistance to all these menaces if they had possessed
plasticity, flexibility in adapting themselves, a desire
for reformation, an eagerness to fall in with every new
demand society might make, a spirit of continuity,
unity, and justice,&mdash;in fact, such a combination of
strong and great qualities as is rarely to be met with
in the history of human institutions.</p>

<p>We shall find that, instead of this, they allowed their
inherent faults and failings, which we have already
discovered in germ, to develop at the very height of
their prosperity.</p>

<p>It will be seen at a glance that three things grew up
in their midst: <i>a lack of solidarity between those who
occupied the various degrees of the hierarchy</i>; <i>divisions
between the different craft guilds</i>; <i>and a narrow traditionalism
which could not even ensure the good quality
of products</i>.</p>

<p>Let us trace the disastrous effects of these three
dissolvent forces.</p>

<p>I. <i>Division in the heart of the Guilds.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>) In principle
there existed in the guild a hierarchy which justified
its own existence. It was founded on age and election.
On the one hand, an inequality which time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
corrected every day and finally did away with.
Adolescence was the age of apprenticeship; early
manhood that of the journeyman; maturity that of
mastership; and a man&rsquo;s earnings, independence, and
power increased not only with the years, but according
to his talent and capabilities. On the other hand&mdash;and
here we have a still more provisional inequality&mdash;the
elected officers received for a few months only, a power
which they exercised under strict control, and then
went modestly back into the ranks.</p>

<p>This order of things, however, was soon upset by the
growing domination of hereditary power and of wealth.</p>

<p>The masters, anxious to secure a life of ease for their
posterity, and filled with a sort of dynastic ambition,
made the acquisition of mastership more and more
difficult for those who had not the good luck to be
their sons, nephews, or sons-in-law. Even in the Middle
Ages they had given way to the influence of domestic
affection, but, as modern times draw nearer, the circle
of the privileged narrows. Those who were connected
with the family by any tie received all the favours;
periods of apprenticeship, rights and expenses of
admissions, were reduced or done away with; technical
proofs of ability degenerated into a simple formality
which could be passed through at home. For every
one else, old obligations were not only maintained but
added to; expenses increased to such an extent that
in France the Crown intervened more than once to
prevent their rise;<a name="FNanchor_128" id="FNanchor_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> crying injustices served as a pretext
for the great ordinance of 1581; candidates were
taken advantage of and made to give banquets, even
when they had been refused admission; the tests became
more and more complicated, cost more and more, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
were often conducted with revolting partiality. As if
this were not enough, the guilds arbitrarily reduced the
number of masterships, some of them refusing to
admit new masters for ten years, while others definitely
decided only to admit the sons of masters. From the
sixteenth century, the butchers in Paris, Poitiers, and
other places quite frankly decreed that mastership
was to be hereditary among them.</p>

<p>The same narrowing down applied to the attainment
of magistracies. The duties of wardens and
officers tended to be perpetuated in certain families:
the electoral lists were weeded out in such a way as
only to include the oldest masters. Sometimes even
the officers nominated their successors, and this gave
them the opportunity of forming a permanent oligarchy
which divided the honours among its members. One
step more in the same direction would have been
enough to make them in turn hereditary.</p>

<p>The influence of money was combined with this
family favouritism, counteracting it at times, but
usually backing it up. None could be master unless
he were rich, for the cost of admission, in the eighteenth
century in France, rose to 1500 and 1800 francs. At the
end of the seventeenth century, in the same country,
the guilds which were in debt themselves sold letters of
mastership to the highest bidder or contracted debts
with their richest members, and even put up the wardenships
for sale.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) These measures, which, through the fault of the
guilds themselves, falsified the normal action of their
statutes, were accompanied by an increasingly strict
subjection of inferiors to superiors.</p>

<p>The journeymen were treated with growing severity.
Not only were they forbidden as heretofore to set up
for themselves, but their condition was certainly worse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
in the seventeenth century than in the thirteenth.
The working day, which averaged twelve hours, was
prolonged to sixteen during the lighter months.
Holidays, reduced in number by the Reformation, were
in turn reduced by the Catholics. La Fontaine&rsquo;s
cobbler, who worked on his own account, complained
of M. le curé who</p>

<blockquote>

<p>De quelque nouveau saint charge toujours son prône.</p></blockquote>

<p>But the journeyman, who had no reason to dislike
so many holidays; was not pleased to find their
number decreasing in the following century. The
increase in the nominal wages was not enough to
compensate for the rise in the price of provisions and
rent; the value of gold and silver had gone down considerably
since the influx of precious metals which the
New World had poured over Europe. More than this,
at the very time when cheap labour was increasing
through the employment of peasants, women, and
children, the jealous persistence of the masters in
barring entrance into the higher grade to those among
their workmen who possessed the necessary capabilities
made the price of hired labour fall still lower.
<i>Compagnonnage</i> acted as a check on these causes of
depression, but it was quite insufficient, and was
hampered in many ways.</p>

<p>This ever-deepening separation between masters
and journeymen was followed by separations between
the masters themselves. In certain guilds they became
divided into the <i>young</i>, <i>modern</i>, <i>old</i>, and <i>bachelor
masters</i>&mdash;these last ex-officers,&mdash;each section possessing
different rights.</p>

<p>The officers abused their rights to visit, search,
seize, and fine; the regulations were so difficult to carry
out literally, that it was always possible to discover<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
some weak point in them by means of which a rival
could be annoyed. Money could also be made at his
expense if the delinquent would and could pay to be
let off. The officers thus created a monopoly within a
monopoly&mdash;and, if we may judge by the enquiries and
lawsuits to which it gave rise,<a name="FNanchor_129" id="FNanchor_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> an extremely profitable
monopoly. In 1684 the officers of the cloth-of-gold and
silk workers were convicted of having taken £72 for
authorizing a breach of the rules. It may well be
imagined what a source of angry discontent were those
breaches of trust, and it will be seen to what an extent
the guild system had been discredited by the very
persons whose mission it was to see it loyally carried out.</p>

<p>2. <i>Division between the craft guilds.</i>&mdash;One is sometimes
tempted to say that the guild system had no
worse enemies than the guilds themselves, so much
bitterness did they display in their quarrels and recriminations.
Town fought with town, and in spite of
the efforts made by the central authority to unite them
they had no idea whatever of agreeing or combining
among themselves. Every one has heard of the interminable
disputes which dragged on between the Hanses
of Paris and Rouen concerning the navigation of the
Seine.<a name="FNanchor_130" id="FNanchor_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> Each had, within its own region, the monopoly
of the transport industry, one from the bridge of
Charenton to that of Nantes, the other, from the latter
point to the mouth of the river. The fight between
the two powerful companies lasted several hundred
years, till at last the day arrived when the two monopolies
were impartially suppressed by the Crown.</p>

<p>In each town, as the line drawn between two crafts
was often vague and purely conventional, the guilds
were more rivals than allied neighbours. Lawsuits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
resulted which, on account of their length and the
expense of legal proceedings, were absolutely ruinous
to both parties. They are mentioned at Poitiers,
which was at law for a century.<a name="FNanchor_131" id="FNanchor_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> At Paris, the lawsuit
between the wine-merchants and the Six Guilds lasted
a hundred and fifty years. The founders within a few
years<a name="FNanchor_132" id="FNanchor_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> entered into actions &ldquo;against the edge-tool makers
to prevent them from making fire-dogs; against the
needle and awl makers to contest their right of selling
thimbles other than those of Paris; against the gilders
to claim from them the exclusive right of founding,
working up, and repairing copper goods; against the
makers of weights and measures to claim equal rights
with them in selling half-pound weights;<a name="FNanchor_133" id="FNanchor_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> against the
pin-makers, makers of kitchen utensils, button-makers,
and sculptors.&rdquo; In England, the bow-makers might not
make arrows, and the right was reserved to a special class
of arrow-makers. Legal expenses for the Paris guilds
alone amounted to nearly a thousand a year towards
the middle of the eighteenth century. From a sense
of <i>esprit de corps</i>, however, they persisted in wasting
their substance, to the benefit of the legal profession
which made enormous profits, and they defied royal
edicts which attempted to restrain their zeal in litigation.
They were far from putting into practice the
motto of the Six Guilds, <i>Vincit concordia fratrum</i>; far
from realizing that solidarity which was the very object
of the guild system.</p>

<p>3. <i>Vexatious regulations.</i>&mdash;The guilds were not only
jealous of each other but also devoid of economic
initiative. This was on account of the privileges they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
held. As each one possessed a monopoly, they were
inclined to go to sleep in the little closed domain
which belonged to them. How could they be expected
to go in search of improvements, when they were so
slow in adopting them? St. Routine was their common
patron. The application of a new method might
promise larger profits or lessen the cost of production;
but it was certain to entail expense, risk, and effort.
It seemed to them easier to shut themselves behind a
wall like the Great Wall of China. Every innovation
encountered their determined opposition. A few instances
chosen from among a thousand will suffice to
prove their obstinate conservatism. I will take one
from Great Britain.<a name="FNanchor_134" id="FNanchor_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a> &ldquo;In 1765, on the eve of those
great inventions which were entirely to transform
working appliances, it was forbidden, under penalty
of a fine, to substitute metal carders for the teazles
still in use in the greater number of the branches of the
textile industry.&rdquo; I will take two other instances from
France; at Poitiers<a name="FNanchor_135" id="FNanchor_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> the cap-makers greeted the advent
of loom-made stockings with marked disfavour, and at
Paris the disputes between Erard, the maker of clavecins,
and the musical-instrument makers are well known.</p>

<p>This exaggerated respect for tradition was also the
result of the change which had taken place in the
internal government of the guilds. Their direction had
passed into the hands of the old members, who, no doubt,
possessed the experience of age, but had also that fear
of everything new so common to those of advanced
years.</p>

<p>Like so many other closed and static bodies, the
guilds were faithful to the past, hostile to the future,
and were to find themselves without resources and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
defenceless when they had to meet the cold but tonic
breath of that competition, which is no doubt cruel for
the weak and death to ill-timed enterprise, but which
is also stimulating to human activity and an encouragement
to the progress of industrial and commercial
technique.</p>

<p>Would that their tyrannical regulations had succeeded
in guaranteeing honest exchange and good
quality of production! In this respect, however, they
no longer exercised the least control. Antoine de
Montchrestien in the time of Henry IV. denounced the
deceptions of commerce and industry.<a name="FNanchor_136" id="FNanchor_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> In England
from the fourteenth century damp spices, second-hand
furs, and sheep-skins passing as buck-skin
were on the market, and in the woollen trade the
principle arose that it is for the buyer to take his own
precautions.<a name="FNanchor_137" id="FNanchor_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Henceforth the statutes were broken by the very
people who had made them and sworn to keep them.
Men were found practising several professions, cornering
raw materials and carrying on clandestine sales below
the fixed tariffs; illegal practices for securing clients
or for enticing away a colleague&rsquo;s workmen became
common. Over and over again the officers and wardens
of a craft had to inflict severe punishments, but in many
cases they were themselves guilty supervisors in need
of supervision! Their frauds often merited the condemnation
they received.</p>

<p>Thus, through their own failings, quite as much as
through the action of unfavourable surroundings, the
guild system dwindled away, till, near the end of the
seventeenth century, it was little more than one of those
worn-out institutions which live on from force of habit;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span>
institutions which one hesitates to help in destroying,
because it is difficult to know how they can be replaced,
but so weak and tottering that they are at the mercy
of the first shock. The eighteenth century was to
give them their <i>coup de grâce</i>.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE DEATH OF THE GUILDS</span></h2>

<p>1. <i>Their suppression in European Countries.</i>&mdash;(<i>a</i>)
The eighteenth century, the first half of which was an
age of analysis, criticism, and social satire, was in its
second half a time of innovation and invention, bold in
its theory and practice, eager to correct and reform
social organization in accordance with an ideal of
justice born of reason. It was therefore both destructive
and constructive.</p>

<p>In its first years it saw the beginning of a new
economic phase. A revolution, as serious as that
caused by the discovery of America and the sea-route
to the Indies, began to operate in the world. As usual,
it was commerce which, by its vast extension, broke
the bounds within which society had been circumscribed.
It was conscious of its importance and dignity.
Voltaire sang the praises of the merchant &ldquo;who enriched
the country, and from his office gives orders to
Surata and Cairo, and contributes to the happiness of
the world.&rdquo; Sedaine, in the <i>Philosophe sans le Savoir</i>,
calls the merchant &ldquo;the man of universe,&rdquo; and compares
the traders to so many &ldquo;threads of silk which
bind together the nations and lead them back to peace
by the needs of commerce.&rdquo; In 1760 Turgot proposed
to ennoble the great traders, and great lords were not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
above going into business. The Duke of La Force was
a wholesale grocer. On the sea there was the continual
coming and going of vessels which ploughed the oceans,
ransacked the archipelagoes, and opened up yet another
continent, Australia, to European conquest: on land,
improved means of communication and transport
trebled the passenger and goods traffic. England at
that time had her &ldquo;canal fever&rdquo;: in France the
wonderful network of roads was the admiration of all
strangers.</p>

<p>In all civilized nations the enterprise of Banks,
Bourses, great Companies and Chambers of Commerce
resulted in such a circulation of money and boldness of
enterprise as had never been seen. All this necessitated
an intensity of production hitherto unknown, and
the invention of new methods. It was now necessary
to create and supply the demands of consumers who
were no longer confined to the limits of a State, however
large it might be, but scattered over the face of the
globe; who no longer numbered a few hundred
thousands, but amounted to dozens or hundreds of
millions. In short, markets began to expand to the
very ends of the earth, and the period of international
economics set in.</p>

<p>In this commercial expansion, European capitalism
played the chief part, and, in Europe, England held
the chief place. Mistress of the sea and of a colonial
empire of which India and North America were the
most valuable possessions, she became enormously
rich; France and Holland followed, but some distance
behind. We already know the natural tendencies of
&ldquo;great&rdquo; commerce: it dislikes all barriers and hindrances
to its activity. It always had been and was
once more inimical to the system of the closed market
so dear to the small craft guilds. Its ideal was free<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
trade. So true is this that in France, in 1654,<a name="FNanchor_138" id="FNanchor_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> the
Six Guilds strongly protested against the taxes which
struck at the importation of goods made outside the
kingdom; moreover the liberal movement against the
guilds emanated from the merchant aristocracy, and
Gournay, its exponent in France, held the title of
director of commerce.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great&rdquo; industry developed with unprecedented
strength under the same impetus. The aged tree, in
which the sap was still rising, suddenly put forth
vigorous branches. In England, engineering and coal-mining
are prime necessaries to its life, and the cotton
industry imported from the Indies attracted many
thousands of workers in a few years and kept them
permanently employed. This industrial revolution
took place both in those vast enterprises in which the
ancient hierarchy of apprentices, journeymen, and
masters became meaningless&mdash;since a handful of masters
possessed the capital and appliances, while the mass of
workmen possessed nothing:&mdash;and in those new enterprises
which, like the manufacture of cotton fabrics,
owed to their recent origin the fact that they had never
been under the old guild system. The guilds themselves
could not but suffer from the extraordinary growth
which took place beside but outside their system.</p>

<p>Three forces in especial worked against them&mdash;three
forces which led to invention, to the transformation
of technique, and so to the overthrow of traditional
rules: these were, the desire to save labour&mdash;a desire
which dominates all human activity,&mdash;science, and
fashion.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) At first, masters and workmen were agreed on
one point&mdash;the reduction of effort which was imposed
on them, and which meant reduction of expenses for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
the former, and reduction of labour for the latter.
Workmen and workwomen had suffered from the
imperfection of the tools they had used, and from the
craft which they carried on; for generations they had
contracted diseases and infirmities which were a trade-mark;
the silk workers of Lyons for instance were
recognized by their bent knees. Having seen their
parents and grandparents die in hospital, tired and worn
out before their time, they eagerly sought for means
whereby they could save themselves, their children, and
their comrades, from dangerous and exhausting work.
They thought out and tried ingenious methods for
lightening their tasks. The first inventors of improvements
were thus workers, familiar with the machines
which were their daily companions. From the time when
the cotton industry became mechanical in England we
can follow the rivalry&mdash;the struggle for speed which for
half a century went on between spinning and weaving,
each in turn getting ahead of and then being passed by
the other;<a name="FNanchor_139" id="FNanchor_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> it was a duel between inventors who were
simple workmen and happened to be mechanics. In
France, Vaucanson and Jacquard did the same thing
for silk in Lyons, where labour was less regulated than
elsewhere. They were encouraged and led by their
masters and sometimes by the State; but they were
unfortunate in unexpectedly encountering the hostility
of the silk workers whom they thought to help.
This was because (and there is nothing which more
clearly demonstrates the faults in the organization of
labour) the introduction of all new machinery, while
it operates in favour of the master by advancing the
speed of production, throws on the streets a certain
number of workmen who are no longer wanted, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>
who, while waiting for increased production to give
them back their means of livelihood, fall a prey to
famine and misery. Montesquieu wrote on this
subject:<a name="FNanchor_140" id="FNanchor_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a></p>

<p>&ldquo;If an article is of a fairly low price, and one which
equally suits him who buys it and the workman who
has made it, machines which would simplify its manufacture,
that is to say diminish the number of workmen,
would be injurious; and if water-mills were not everywhere
established, I should not believe them to be as
useful as people say, because they throw innumerable
hands out of work....&rdquo;</p>

<p>This explains the curious spectacle offered by the
world of labour in the eighteenth century; the masters
in &ldquo;great&rdquo; industry, like the wholesale traders, were
the revolutionaries; their workmen, like the guilds,
were the reactionaries.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) Science, however, was not long in coming to the
rescue of the inventors who had risen from the working
class. The scientists, whose function it is to increase
human knowledge and the power of men over nature,
gave proof in their turn of creative imagination; they
captured and tamed hitherto unused or rebel forces:
steam, subdued and enslaved, became the magician
which began by giving movement to bands, wheels,
hands of steel and iron, carriages and boats, and ended
by carrying on every sort of craft. It could spin,
weave, screw, rivet, plane, full, lift up, saw, cut off,
glean, thresh corn, etc. Chemistry and physics were
by no means inferior to mechanical science; they composed
and decomposed bodies, transformed and melted
them one into another, created new ones by bold combinations,
produced heat, light, and energy. What
weight had the old regulations in view of this trans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>formation
of methods and appliances? Who could
uphold them? The guilds in defending them were
like men with spades who should try to stop a train
going at full speed.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) Fashion acts in the same manner, for the word
is synonymous with change. It is a power in every
country, but particularly where there is smart, worldly
society. The guilds learnt this to their cost in a
matter which was the talk of the court for years. In
France an edict, inspired by them, had prohibited
the use of printed cottons which came from India.
They might be seized anywhere, even on people who
were wearing them. But it was an absurd notion to
try to check by force the changes of taste, when women,
who love novelty in dress as much as they often do in
matters of belief and custom, took it into their heads
to wear a material which pleased them! The Marquise
of Nesles appeared openly in the gardens of the
Tuileries, dressed in Indian cotton. They dared not
arrest her! Other Court ladies did as she had done,
and, after a long struggle, printed cottons won the day;
they were installed at the very gates of Paris, and
made the fortune of Oberkampf their manufacturer,
and were well known under the name of &ldquo;toiles de
Jouy&rdquo;!</p>

<p>(<i>e</i>) While the defences behind which the guilds had
taken refuge were thus battered down, a crusade
against them was begun by public opinion. Economists
and philosophers united in attacking their
principles in the name of liberty and equality, two
ideas which roused much enthusiasm in the world at
that time. The guilds were denounced as opposed to
the general interest of producers in that they stood for
privilege and exclusiveness and prevented numbers of
people, who could neither enter them nor set up beside<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>
them, from earning an honest livelihood. They were
condemned as being contrary to the general interests
of consumers; for, burdened with enormous debts,
wasting their money in festivals, feasts, and legal expenses,
condemned to laborious methods of manufacture
through their inability to improve them, they
were yet able by means of their monopolies to keep
up prices and to make unduly large profits, without
even being capable of satisfying their clients if they
expressed the smallest desire to have something out of
the ordinary.</p>

<p>The physiocrats had another grievance against the
guilds: they were opposed to them because they
diverted capital from the cultivation of the land, in
which, according to them, it would have been used to
much greater advantage. By degrees, among the two
peoples which led the European thought of the time&mdash;Great
Britain and France,&mdash;these accusations were condensed
into a formula which was the death-warrant of
the guilds: <i>Laissez-faire! Laissez-passer!</i> At Edinburgh
in 1776 Adam Smith&rsquo;s famous work appeared,
and was looked on as the Gospel of the new doctrine.
In 1775 there appeared in Paris a posthumous work by
President Bigot of Sainte-Croix, entitled <i>An Essay on
the Freedom of Commerce and Industry</i>.</p>

<p>2. It was in England, the country in which regulation
was then weakest and where it had not touched
great cities like Manchester and Birmingham,<a name="FNanchor_141" id="FNanchor_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> where
&ldquo;great&rdquo; commerce and &ldquo;great&rdquo; industry made the
strongest and most rapid advances, that these theories
most quickly triumphed, born as they were of surrounding
realities. But, in accordance with the English
custom, there was no violent rupture with the past,
no solemn repudiation of theories hitherto followed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
no complete and sudden abolition of the guild system.
The change in economic organization came by a series
of small local and partial measures. The Statute
of Labourers had in 1563 unified and codified the rules
of the Middle Ages; these were not wholly repealed,
but, in 1728,<a name="FNanchor_142" id="FNanchor_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> the master hat-makers, dyers, and
cotton printers demanded of Parliament (and obtained
their demand fifty years later) that they should be
exempt from obeying the rules as to the number
of apprentices, who might be replaced by men hands.
In 1753 the statutes of the stocking-makers were
abolished as &ldquo;injurious and vexatious to the manufacturers&rdquo;
and &ldquo;hurtful to the trade,&rdquo; as &ldquo;against
all reason and opposed to the liberty of English subjects.&rdquo;
In vain the workers sometimes united with the
small masters, and sought behind these crumbling
shelters protection against the ills inflicted on them
by the development of &ldquo;great&rdquo; industry and of
machinery; in vain they hoped for the application of
the law which entrusted to the justices of the peace
the duty of fixing their wages; in vain they made
enormous sacrifices to get their rights established in
legal documents.<a name="FNanchor_143" id="FNanchor_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> From the year 1756 the weavers
of napery were abandoned to their fate by the House
of Commons. After a period of hesitation and self-contradiction,
&ldquo;governmental nihilism&rdquo; became under
similar circumstances the policy of Parliament. But
it was still more than half a century before the statute
of 1563, which had survived from a former age, disappeared
under the blows struck at it by the &ldquo;great&rdquo;
tradesmen; it was suspended, then abolished for the
wool industry in 1809, and finally done away with in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
1814. Almost at the same date, in 1813, the right of
fixing the wages of labour was taken away from justices
of the peace. Of the economic legislation of the
Middle Ages, there still remained the laws which prohibited
workers from forming any sort of combination,
and decided that in every dispute the word of a master
should be accepted before that of a servant; but of
the guilds nothing was left but atrophied and lifeless
bodies, which were little more than memories, or names
often given to what were far from being professional
associations.</p>

<p>In France, where there is a love of unity, logic, and
harmony, things developed differently. Guild monopolies
continued, it is true, by means of bribery;
but their domain was narrowed by the creation of
the Sèvres factory and the Royal Printing Press,
and by the working of many mines at the expense
of the State. In 1762 all industrial privileges were
limited to fifteen years, a serious menace directed against
privileges which had been held to be perpetual. In the
same year the freedom of rural industry was proclaimed;
in 1763 that of the leather trade, and in 1765 that of
wholesale trade for commons as well as nobles. The
corn trade, in spite of the fear of monopoly, profited by
a similar liberty for a short time (1763). Simultaneously,
the guilds were stripped, and their doors thrown open.
In 1755 it was decided that foreign journeymen might
be hired in every town in the kingdom except Paris,
Lyons, Lille, and Rouen. In 1767 the doors were
opened wide to foreigners and Jews&mdash;competitors as
much hated as feared. In the same year the invasion
was completed by a large number of letters of mastership
which gave every craft in Paris twelve new masters,
and every craft in the provinces from eight to two, while
the purchase of these licences by the Six Guilds was not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>
authorized even if a larger sum were offered. Monopoly
was therefore extended, not destroyed. But such a
solution was merely a compromise, and things developed
in the direction of suppression pure and simple.</p>

<p>It was Turgot, as every one knows, who took upon
himself to do away with wardenships and masterships.
A disciple of both Gournay and Quesnay, he condemned
them in the name of industry and agriculture, and in
the interests of consumers and producers. The famous
edict of March 1776, which he signed as minister of
Louis XVI., declared that they were abolished throughout
the kingdom with four exceptions: the <i>wig-makers</i>,
who held posts sold to them by the State itself; the
<i>printer-booksellers</i>, the supervision of whom was kept
by the authorities for political reasons; the <i>goldsmiths</i>,
because the sale of precious metals was under special
legislation; and the <i>apothecaries</i>, as the control of their
trade was considered necessary for public health.
The property of the guilds was sold and the proceeds,
together with the funds in hand, were used for wiping
out their debts. The confraternities were done away
with at the same time, and their wealth handed over to
the bishops. All associations of masters or journeymen
were prohibited.</p>

<p>Such an edict, completely revolutionizing the organization
of labour, could not pass without obstruction and
resistance. The Parlement, as defender of the ancient
traditions of France, only registered it under protest
and at the express wish of the king; the Six Guilds
were defended by the writings of a man whose name
will for ever have a sinister sound&mdash;Dr. Guillotin. The
unrest was intense; the freedom of the corn trade
served as a pretext, if not a real cause, for riots known
as the &ldquo;flour war.&rdquo; Turgot had made a St. Bartholomew
of privileges, therefore all the privileged com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>bined
against him. The king said to him, &ldquo;Only
you and I love the people, M. Turgot.&rdquo; Some days
after, the king dismissed him, and, on August 28, the
edict was repealed. Wardens and masters were reestablished,
first in Paris and a little later in the other
towns. But so decayed a system as this could not
suffer even the most passing effacement with impunity.
At first it did not reappear in its entirety and the
number of free crafts remained considerably larger. It
could only live at all by reforming itself, so the rights
and expenses of reception were reduced by half, two-thirds,
or sometimes even three-quarters; kindred
crafts were fused and the practice of several crafts at
once authorized; women were admitted to mastership
in men&rsquo;s communities and <i>vice versa</i>; foreigners, too,
could now aspire to mastership. But the original
narrowness persisted; a new inequality sprang up
between <i>masters</i> and <i>fellows</i>; the rules for maintaining
internal discipline and the domestic authority of the
employers over the workmen became, not less, but
more rigorous; the journeymen were still forbidden
to have common funds, to assemble without permission,
or to be together more than three at a time; to carry
arms, to concern themselves with the hiring of labour,
to leave work unfinished, or to present themselves
without a letter of discharge from their last master.
A strike could always be punished as a desertion
of work. A maximum wage was always fixed as well
as the time allowed for the mid-day meal. The regulations
for manufacture, however, became less strict;
under Necker&rsquo;s ministry, the manufacturer might choose
whether he would conform to them or not. If he did,
he had the right to have his goods stamped, and stuffs
so made were distinguished by a special selvage; other
products received the &ldquo;stamp of freedom.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>The commercial treaty, concluded with England in
1786, severely tried the system already so weakened.
The guilds suddenly found themselves exposed at many
points to foreign competition, and complained bitterly
when the convocation of the States-General gave France
the opportunity of expressing her opinion, along with
other more important subjects, on the existence of the
guilds.</p>

<p>The debate reports of 1789 betray a certain indecision
on the matter; the two privileged classes&mdash;nobles
and clergy&mdash;when they were not indifferent
to the whole question, leant towards suppression; the
Third Estate&mdash;for the election of which the small
crafts had not received equal treatment with &ldquo;great&rdquo;
commerce, the liberal professions, and the rich bourgeoisie&mdash;were
divided almost equally, one half favouring the
abolition, the other the reformation, which implied
the retention, of the system.</p>

<p>Apparently at first the latter carried the day. On
the night of August 4, 1789, the reformation of masterships
was one of the numerous motions voted with
enthusiasm. But less than two years later, in March
1791, in a bill for the taxation of licences, the
mover, Dallard, had the following article (number 8),
inserted:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>From April 1 next, inclusive, every citizen will be free to
carry on whatever profession or trade seems good to him,
after having procured and paid for a licence.</p></blockquote>

<p>This meant the end of masterships and wardenships.
An indemnity was to be allowed the masters for the
money they had spent, and to the wigmakers and to
the barbers for the posts they had bought. With no
fuss, almost without discussion, and without finding
any one to defend them in the Assembly, the guilds<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
ceased to be after an existence which had lasted for
many centuries.</p>

<p>In June of the same year, a new law was
destined to stifle any inclination they might have
shown to come to life again. The pretext given for
condemning them to their fate was the formation of
societies of workers with the object of raising wages.
Chapelier, affirming that it was the duty of the State
to assist the infirm and find work for those who needed
it in order to live, protested against every association
which claimed to substitute a collective contract for
the individual contract between master and workers.<a name="FNanchor_144" id="FNanchor_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a>
Article 2 of the law in question reads:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Citizens of the same condition or profession, middlemen,
those who keep open shops, workmen and <i>compagnons</i> of
whatever art, may not, when they find themselves together,
nominate president, secretary or syndic, keep registers, pass
resolutions, make regulations for what they claim to be
their common interests, or bind themselves by agreements
leading to the concerted refusal or to the granting only at
a certain price, of the help of their industry and labours.</p></blockquote>

<p>According to a phrase taken from a petition addressed
by the master-builders to the municipality of
Paris, the above resolutions and agreements, if they
ever happened to be made, had to be declared &ldquo;unconstitutional,
opposed to liberty and to the declaration
of the rights of Man&rdquo;; the authors, instigators, and
signatories of these acts or writings were to pay a fine
of £500 each, and to be deprived for a year of their
rights of active citizenship. Severer penalties were
provided in all cases of threat and unlawful assembly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>Thus pure reaction, excessive and impracticable,
set in against trade combination; compulsory isolation
was established under the false name of freedom of
work, and in consequence the weak were abandoned to
the mercy of the strong, and the poor to the mercy of
the rich; the individual, naked and unarmed, was put
face to face with the individual armed at every point;
in the economic domain a mere agglomeration was
substituted for any kind of organization. But besides
being the culminating point of a long evolution, this
reaction was the starting-point of a new development
which created the modern Labour Movement. We
must next take a rapid survey of Europe and see what
was the fate of the guilds in other countries.</p>

<p>In Holland, where they had never been very strong,
they counted for nothing after 1766. In Tuscany,
from 1759 to 1766, a great inquiry was held into the
state of the <i>Arti</i>, and following on the information
obtained, the Archduke Peter-Leopold brought about,
by means of decrees, a reform which was revolutionary
in character. On February 3, 1770, he abolished enrolment
fees throughout the duchy, with the exception of
two or three small territories like that of Livurnia, and
decided that, in order to ply a trade, it should be enough
henceforth to be inscribed once and for all on a general
register. In consideration of a fee of £2 at most, a man
might, if he wanted to, follow more than one calling
or open several shops. The only exceptions were the
doctors, apothecaries, and goldsmiths, who were still
subject to special obligations, and silk manufacturers,
who kept a few ancient privileges. On February 17
of that year all the guild tribunals were abolished and
all their powers vested in a <i>Chamber of Commerce, Arts,
and Manufactures</i>, which had not only legal rights but
also the duty of watching over the economic interests<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
of the country, encouraging and assisting poor craftsmen,
and administering the estates formerly held by the
guilds which had thus been wiped out at a stroke of
the pen. The clauses are curious and confirm what
we have said concerning the action of princes. The
Archduke expresses his wish that &ldquo;such matters shall
be regulated by a single authority, on fixed and uniform
principles directed to the universal good of the State.&rdquo;
The bakers were no longer compelled to make loaves of
a fixed weight; the merchants were exempted from
paying for weights and measures which they hardly
ever used but which they were forced to possess.<a name="FNanchor_145" id="FNanchor_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> The
glorious guilds of Florence had lived for centuries and
were to leave their mark behind them for a long time
to come; it was only in 1907 that the winding-up of the
property which had belonged to the <i>Arte della Lana</i> was
concluded.</p>

<p>In Lombardy, from 1771 onwards, under the rule of
the Empress Maria Theresa, a similar reform took
place; in 1786 it was Sicily&rsquo;s turn; throughout the
rest of Italy, all that remained of the ancient guild
system disappeared under the French domination and
the Napoleonic Code. The same thing happened in
Belgium, where, after the decree of 17 Brumaire,
Year IV., nothing was left but shadowy guilds, such
as that of St. Arnoldus at Bruges, or the &ldquo;Nations&rdquo;
at Antwerp.<a name="FNanchor_146" id="FNanchor_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> In Germany the guild system was more
tenacious and was only to disappear, in certain States,
when German unity was almost realized. The Code of
the Confederation of Northern Germany declared for
its abolition in all the countries under its jurisdiction.</p>

<p>3. The guilds, then, were long in dying, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
addition to a few survivals,<a name="FNanchor_147" id="FNanchor_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> there were even some
attempts made here and there to revive them during
the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>In France, from the days of the Consulate and of the
Empire, professional guilds (notaries, lawyers, solicitors,
law-court officers, stockbrokers, etc.) were formed and
still exist. The practice of more than one profession&mdash;such
as medicine, dispensing, printing&mdash;remained under
the control of the public authority. Butchers and
bakers, under new regulations, remained in this state
till 1858 and 1863. In 1805, three hundred wine-sellers
demanded, without success, the restoration of the old
craft guilds and of their own in particular. Under the
Restoration, which undertook the task of restoring
institutions which the storms of the Revolution had
destroyed, other petitions of the same nature found a
few partisans in the &ldquo;<i>Chambre Introuvable</i>&rdquo; and in some
of the General Councils;<a name="FNanchor_148" id="FNanchor_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> but although &ldquo;the small&rdquo;
crafts were in favour of this return to the past, &ldquo;great&rdquo;
trade, which had been hostile to wardenships and
masterships, was strongly opposed to it. The Chamber
of Commerce of Paris and the bankers were among the
first to fight and defeat these ideas.</p>

<p>It is among Catholics especially that such ideas have
been awakened; inspired by sincere pity for the misery
of the working classes who have been so long without
protection, they have often been filled with the desire
to create an organization for the propagation of social
peace between masters and workers. During the reign
of Louis-Philippe, Buchez, Villeneuve Bargemont, La
Farelle, and Buret tried to bring the guild idea to life<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
again. In 1848 it publicly reappeared for a short time,
when the provisional government received hundreds
of deputations classed according to their trades, and
Louis Blanc nominated, according to craft guilds, delegates
for the Commission of the Luxembourg, and
when <i>compagnonnage</i> paraded its beribboned canes
and splendid works of art in the processions of the
republican festivals; but it was already modified;
masters and workmen formed separate groups. More
recently, in 1891, it has been advocated in eloquent
but vague terms by Pope Leo XIII., and Catholic
circles, founded by M. de Mun, have tried to put it
into practice.</p>

<p>But it has always encountered obstacles which have
arrested its progress. First there have been disagreements
between those who favour the idea. Should
the guild be optional or compulsory, open or closed?
What share should masters and workmen take in it?
Should it aim only at mutual assistance, or should it be
competent to act in disputes between members? On
the one hand there were those who were afraid of
reviving the tyrannical monopoly of the old wardenships
and on the other those who were afraid of forming,
without meaning to do so, the framework for a socialistic
organization of labour. All this was enough to paralyse
those who might have been willing to join. But there
was an even greater difficulty; though some of the
great employers, those of the Val des Bois for example,
supported the cause, the working classes, not unreasonably,
stood aloof, uneasy and defiant. They dreaded
any sort of patronage in which the heads would bombard
them with pious exhortations and hold up to them
the dismal virtue of resignation; they remembered
M. Claudio Jannet&rsquo;s confession that he looked to
Christianity &ldquo;to solve the social question by inspiring<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>
masters with the spirit of justice and charity, and by
making the less-favoured classes <i>accept their lot</i>.&rdquo; They
could not forget that the Holy Father had written that
the guilds should have &ldquo;religion for their guide,&rdquo; and
they thought they had a foretaste of the fate in store
for them, in the statutes of association of the printer-bookseller-bookbinders
of Paris in the new model
(1879): &ldquo;<i>Art.</i> III. To belong a man must be a Catholic.
<i>Art.</i> IV. Must bind himself not to work, or employ
another on Sunday. <i>Art.</i> V. To print no irreligious
book.&rdquo; In short, they were afraid of putting themselves
under the yoke of the confessional and of losing their
liberty of thought, and they looked on an institution
from which were excluded in advance all who did not
hold a certificate of orthodoxy, as too much resembling
the Middle Ages, and as an anachronism in a society
where rights are equal for all citizens irrespective of
religion.</p>

<p>A few theorists<a name="FNanchor_149" id="FNanchor_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a> no doubt prided themselves on
enlarging this narrow conception; but the compulsory
guilds, open and federated, which they dreamed
of instituting, were so different from the old guilds
that there was really nothing in common except the
name.</p>

<p>It was in Austria, in surroundings less cut off from
the past than in France, that guilds more resembling
the original type awoke to an appearance of life.<a name="FNanchor_150" id="FNanchor_150"></a><a href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a>
Created by law in 1883, they have set before themselves
some of the aims of the <i>Arti</i> of Florence, viz. the safeguarding
of the honour of the trade and, to this end,
the regulation of apprenticeship; the foundation or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>
assistance of institutions for technical instruction; the
exaction of a preliminary examination from any one
who wishes to set up as a craftsman or merchant;
the buying of raw material at the expense of the
community; the provision of arbitrators to settle
trade differences, and the insurance of members
against sickness, etc. They even try, as in old times,
to secure the legal monopoly of a craft and to forbid
hawking, etc. They remind one very much of what
I have called the <i>capitalistic guilds</i> of the Middle
Ages, and those of great commerce and &ldquo;great&rdquo;
industry, with the sole difference that they are compulsory
for all who carry on the same trade. (See
<a href="#Page_28">p. 28</a>.) All the authority, in fact, is in the hands of
the masters, and although they are reminded of their
duties towards the workers, the latter are subordinate,
can only present petitions, and are only allowed to
decide as to the administration of benefit funds. It is
more than doubtful whether this reproduction of the
most hierarchical form of the ancient guilds has much
chance of spreading at a time when ideas of equality
have made such headway and when the working
classes are strong enough to refuse meekly to submit
to the conditions employers lay down. It must also
be remembered that &ldquo;great&rdquo; industry, for and by
whom this method was formerly designed, is excepted
from Austrian legislation, which forces it on the &ldquo;small&rdquo;
trades, to which this renewal of the regulations of the
old statutes seems to be a great hindrance. Imitation
of this system, which is itself only a more or less successful
imitation, has so far not gone farther than Hungary
and Germany (the <i>Innungen</i>). In Belgium, Switzerland,
and even in France, Christian associations are to
be found on the same model. They always include two
groups which never assimilate; masters and workmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
who have separate representation and pay unequal
subscriptions. The principle is always Charity, the
devotion of one class to another, no doubt an honourable
sentiment, but one with which is mingled a protective
spirit it seems impossible to do away with. For
Pope Leo XIII. himself, in his Encyclical of May 16,
1891, states that, in civilized society, it is impossible
that every one shall rise to the same level, and that,
in consequence, there will always be rich and poor.
&ldquo;Just as, in the human body, the members, in spite
of their diversity, adapt themselves so marvellously
to each other as to form a perfectly proportioned
whole, which may be called symmetrical, so, in
society, the <i>two classes</i> are destined by nature to
unite in harmony, and to maintain together a perfect
balance.&rdquo; Life and experience, however, would seem
to prove the opposite. The only thing to be gained by
these attempts to return to a time that has disappeared
for ever is the combination of crafts&mdash;a necessity
which seeks to-day, as it has always done, its legitimate
satisfaction. But new methods of production and sale
demand new forms of organization of sellers and
producers, and have brought us to the system, evolved
by those concerned, spontaneously, without prejudiced
or preconceived theories, by the direct force of circumstances&mdash;the
system of <i>Trade Unionism</i>, which has
succeeded the guild system as the defender of trade
interests.</p>

will be found in M. Martin-Saint-Léon&rsquo;s <i>Histoire des corporations de
métier</i>, book i., 2nd edition. We recommend it to the reader, but
do not ourselves accept all the author&rsquo;s opinions. As, however, he
chiefly gives the German, English, and French sources of information,
we add a list of Italian works, or works concerning Italy, which deal
with the same subject, classifying them according to the theories
they adopt.
</p>
<p>
The theory of the separate creation of each guild is defended by
M. Arrigo Solmi (<i>Le Assoziazioni in Italia avanti le origini del
Commune</i>, 1898), but since then the works and criticisms of Messrs.
Robert Davidsohn, Alfred Doren, Hartmann, and Bonolis have
deprived his arguments of all that was strongest and most original
in them. M. Solmi, in an article in the <i>Rivista Italiana di Sociologia</i>,
ix. 1 (Roma, 1905), entitled &ldquo;Sulla storia economica d&rsquo;Italia nel medio
evo,&rdquo; himself recognized that the persistence of certain ancient institutions
and the division of labour in the great royal or feudal
domains appear to have played an important part in the organization
of crafts. M. Nino Tamassia has specially emphasized, amongst
other causes, the part played by the influence of religious congregations
and fraternities.</p></div>
